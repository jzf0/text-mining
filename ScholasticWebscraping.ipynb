      "Art or Fart: An Pragmatic Study of American Art Education \n",
      "For an overactive student, daydreaming through the history of Ceramics, sleeping through an Art Appreciation lecture, or discussing the meaning of Aesthetic, is not one’s idea of fun or learning. At the end of the semester, the student hasn’t learned a thing. This boring arts class is basically a filler, simply intended to fill the one and only credit required for graduation, and out of it came one, lonely ceramic bowl. \n",
      "Unfortunately, this is the story of millions of American students — the story of art education that is barely arts, and hardly education. American art education is failing. The definition of art education prevalent in the United States is an idea dissimilar from the rest of the world. It’s an idea that builds upon the ideas of literature, science and mathematics, and not the creativity and beauty that arise within a treble clef and a brushstroke. It’s time to bring back art education effectively, with a full and mandatory curriculum, classes that are independant from core categories, required in public education, and available for all. It’s time to take the education out of the arts, and put the arts back into the education. \n",
      "The definition of arts education has devolved into ambiguity over the last 40 years, but the National Center of Education Statistics has grouped art education into four main categories, classes that involve visual arts, music, drama, and dance (Parsad et. al, 2012). In general, art education, which includes at least one of these four categories, is offered by 91% of American public schools (Parsad et. al, 2012) — but what are the more detailed constraints? \n",
      "Upon closer review, the the idea of art education is a lot less widespread today. In a 2009-2010 school year study by the National Center for Education Statistics, within the 91% of public schools that offer art education, 93% offered visual arts, 91% offered music, 14% offered dance, and 48% offered drama and theatre (Parsad, 2012, p.5). Although the music and visual arts percentages are high, the number of schools who offer dance and theater is dismal. That means that less than 50% of American public schools offer half of art education. It only gets worse form there. Only 57% of all secondary schools reported that a course in the arts was a necessary requirement for graduation, and the schools that did require art courses for graduation, about 70% reported that one, singular credit was required (Parsad, 2012, p.5). That’s about a semester of art classes. Already, that initial 91% has been cut in two, cut in two again, and almost cut in two after that. \n",
      "What ever happened to American art education, and how did it become like this — a skeleton of a true and comprehensive curriculum? To answer this question, it’s necessary to trace art education all the way back to the 1830s, when the idea was first pioneered. It started with Horace Mann, who not only trail-blazed the idea of art education, but also the idea of public schooling entirely. Mann defined society as a collection of strong-minded, self-governing individuals. According to Mann, one of the best ways to elevate a strong-minded society is by promoting mental growth, and thus emerged a teaching pedagogy which involved the furthering of mental strength; Mann claimed that powerful mental structures trump physical and emotional structures. One of the key points that Mann emphasized in education was that the arts could build upon all structures of self — for example, singing and visual art involved physical improvement through lung power, emotional improvement through “peace, hope and affection”(Raber, 2017), and mental improvement by noticing mathematical relationships between notes and tones. Art education hits all of Mann’s major points: physical, emotional, and mental. \n",
      "So, art education was implemented along with the nation’s first public schooling system. For 70 years, the program survived successfully. (Raber, 2017). However, in 1893, the arts were omitted from the public school system as they lacked “mental disciplinary value”(Raber, 2017). They weren’t regulated enough, and didn’t have enough worth in life to actually be taught, the 1893 Committee of Ten argued. \n",
      "The Civil War brought with it a new era in intellectualism and teaching philosophy, and art education was once more reinvigorated by Hegelian philosophers, who argued that the principles of repetition within the arts are simulating the “the stages of the individual’s induction into civilization”(Raber, 2017). Continued momentum built during the Progressive Era, as philosophers like William Toney Harris claimed that a full education means that all lessons, including sciences, mathematics, literature, and the arts, build upon one’s previous knowledge and interest, forming seamlessly into one curriculum that is based upon expressiveness and individuality. \n",
      "    The Cold War is when art education began its gradual and eventual decline. In 1957, the launch of Sputnik 1 seemed to leave the United States behind in an endless competition for worldwide superiority (Raber, 2017). Education was blamed; politicians looked for a way to completely refurbish the United States educational system, and it began with completely forgetting about art education. Suddenly, everything became occupation-based and individualistic. While focusing on the topics of science and math, the idea of a “talented elite” was introduced; now, the majority of the people would receive a rudimentary academic training in core classes, whereas the gifted best would receive special and higher quality occupational education, based on test score results. (Raber, 2017).\n",
      "This system was met with vengeance by American educators, who argued that the arts were indeed an occupation, artists were talented specialists who existed to depict human experience and life itself, and thus every student needed this education (Raber, 2017). Their efforts failed; many aspects from the Cold War antiquated system carried over to America’s educational system decades afterwards, including the idea that art education can only be reserved for talented students. \n",
      "And such came the art education that America sees today. In 2008, art education programs were slashed across the country and thousands of arts specialists were laid off as the country began to collapse economically; in 2010, the Common Core State Standards Initiative was introduced. Astonishingly, visual arts were entirely omitted from the program (Raber, 2017). This widespread restructuring had widespread effects on students with low socioeconomic class; In 1999, 100% of students that qualified for free or reduced lunches (such that their household income was 100%-185% poverty level) were offered music education. In 2012, that figure was a sad 81%. Additionally, from 2008 to 2012, the percentage of schools offering drama dropped from a melancholy 20% to a mouth-dropping 4% (Association of American Educators, 2012). \n",
      "This problem has evolved into an equity issue; the depth of course offering, the availability of a full education in the arts has widely been available only to those with a high socioeconomic class, leaving students who live on the brink of the poverty line with limited or no access to art classes at their school (Association of American Educators, 2012). Minorities were among the most effected by the cuts — today, only 26.2% of African American students have access to art classes (Gregory, 2016).\n",
      "Many studies about arts education aimed their focus directly at underserved schools. The National Endowment for The Arts is an independant, federally funded agency that helps expose students-at-risk to high-quality arts programs (Miller, 2017). In 2008 and 2016, a national assessment known as the Nation’s Report Card was conducted, and students’ knowledge of the arts (visual arts and music) were assessed. \n",
      "The results were quite interesting; in a test out of 300 points, the average score for Hispanic students increased by 6 points, from 129 to 135 points since 2008. Additionally, students that qualified for a free or reduced lunch program, such that they had a household income of 100 -185% poverty level, had a 5-point increase in their scores in the 8 year difference (Association of American Educators, 2012) Organizations like the National Endowment for the Arts, the Americans for the Arts, and Arts for Life are responsible for this success. Not only did these organizations reach out to underserved youth, but they were able to demonstrate that students who are exposed to art education experience positive growth at school. \n",
      "To add more fuel to the fire, these organizations are being bulldozed as President Trump reduces their budget — over 30 million dollars of funding has been cut from The National Endowment for the Arts; its budget was diminished from $176 million to $146 million (Joseph, 2016).\n",
      "    As more and more art education programs are tossed into the trash, more and more research has proven the positive effects of an arts education on children. For example, there is a high correlation between students that are exposed to a high level of art education and cognitive ability. In 2002, neuroscientists found that students that had been exposed to arts programs had advanced attention skills and developed creative thinking solutions; students were able to identify complex relations between musical or artistic qualities. This attention towards this difference in art translated into innovation(Bush, 2018). Put in simpler terms, students became more creative and critical thinkers because of their development in the arts. \n",
      "This is only confirmed by the demands of the 21st century workforce. A 2006 report, titled Are You Ready to Work?, found that skills like teamwork, critical thinking, and problem solving are all skills that surpass other skills like mathematics, science, and reading comprehension. Not only that, but creativity and innovation was listed among the top five attributes (Bush, 2018). As mentioned, having exposure to arts education dramatically improves critical thinking skills, problem solving, and creativity. So, top attributes of workers in today’s society are bolstered by art education, the needs for it in the education system in America is only amplified. \n",
      "One might claim that classes in the arts distract from other, more important subjects; Lavine (2018) argued that “a student is required to take a certain number of art classes, which can be taking valuable time away from other, more enriching courses [such as] ...AP or Honors courses.” This, however, is directly opposing all of research done by influential organizations such as the National Endowment for the Arts. When students were exposed to arts education, their scores on tests rose significantly, as evident from the score improvement in 2008-2016. In addition, AP classes aren’t for everyone — they require a high level of commitment and academic challenge that is not available to students-at-risk, and they are weighed differently by different colleges (Cooper, 2017). However, art education has been proven to be beneficial to all students.\n",
      "Arts education is especially powerful, and even necessary, when it comes to kids with Autism. Many students were implemented into a dance program, and enormous changes were observed. Not only did the autistic students increase their physical ability, coordination, and strength, but the program was also influential by “enhancing overall wellbeing by reducing potential risks which are often associated to loneliness, isolation and poor social identity” (Roncaglia, 2018, p.2). Along with athletic improvement, students also noted powerful mental growth as well. Roncaglia also noted that the arts education programs help children overcome barriers that are seen as roadblocks to their development, like social and emotional skills (2018, p.6). By undergoing live performances, the children were able to simulate real-life occurrences through their performances, meaning that they could have a space in which they could grow and develop without pressure.\n",
      "So the arts are essential to growth and development in the life of any student. They improve cognitive ability, help improve scores on standardized tests, and especially help students at risk. But there is one puzzle piece missing: what is the most effective way that art education is applied? In what ways has it been proven to be successfully integrated into an entire public school curriculum? How can we do art education right? To further investigate these questions, it’s necessary to take a look at entire countries that have applied successful education techniques.\n",
      "Take Finland, for example. Finland is a country that wasn’t doing so well in their schooling system. About 40 years ago, their education mingled in with its mediocre brother, the United States of America. Now, however, they differentiate from America in several ways; they only have 1 standardized test mandated, and have hour-long lunch hours, and can learn many different languages, but the real difference between the two education systems is, without a doubt, their arts education curriculum. \n",
      "Art education in Finland is entirely mandatory, and fully includes all four categories: physical education, music, visual arts, and crafts. Students have a wide variety of options including full drama opportunities, concerts, exhibitions, and cultural education. “Art is essential for personal development and wellbeing”(Busnatch, n.d, p.1), according to a report on Finnish art education. “Art plays an important role in promoting a child’s creativity, which applies to all subject areas...progressing from one level to another, it is goal oriented” (Busnatch, n.d, p.1). Consider this situation in a typical Finnish elementary classroom: \n",
      "“A class of first graders scampered among nearby pine and birch trees, each holding a stack of the teacher’s homemade laminated ‘outdoor math’ cards. ‘Find a stick as big as your foot,’ one read. ‘Gather 50 rocks and acorns and lay them out in groups of ten,’ read another. Working in teams, the 7- and 8-year-olds raced to see how quickly they could carry out their tasks” (Hancock, 2011). \n",
      "What here is different from learning multiplication tables in a classroom? What here is different from filling out a worksheet?\n",
      "The answer is art. The students are required to be artistic, and are forced to use artistic techniques to learn. Students learn math in creative and fun ways (such as this situation, where students are required to collect outdoor materials), think creatively by singing songs, and exercise imaginative individuality by wearing costumes to school (Hancock, 2011). Success emerges from empowerment and individuality. It’s not based off of occupation, the standardized tests, or memorization. The Finnish education system has nailed what art education is supposed to be: a comprehensive, full curriculum. \n",
      "America’s art system is failing, but it’s not dead yet. A full art education in America is possible; it happened over 175 years ago when intellectuals and philosophers like Horace Mann explored the idea of public education itself. Over time, the idea of the arts have been slowly degraded and worn down by fear, superiority, and ignorance. But this fear and superiority can be overcome with research and implementation. Horace Mann was right. Art education isn’t just a wasteful class; it improves test scores, is valued in the workforce, and provides beneficial and growing environments for students at risk, and even improves attention and analyzation skills. \n",
      "Small steps can create big leaps; it’s time to provide more funding to art programs like the National Endowment for the Arts, add back art classes to underserved schools, and reintroduce drama and dance. Above all, art classes must be completely independant from core subjects and available to all students.It’s time to quash the idea that the arts are imprudent and wasteful. It’s time to equalize, time to integrate, time to innovate. Let’s open the floodgates to a creative, powerful, and artistic future. \n",

      "The Widening Chasm between Happiness & Joy\n",
      " \n",
      "            “Joy is not in things; it is in us” – Richard Wagner. The exploration of happiness and joy initially appears as a simple endeavour; however, their connection and purpose exist separately. Google Dictionary defines happiness as \"feelings ranging from contentment and satisfaction to bliss and intense pleasure,\" whereas joy \"is a stronger, less common feeling than happiness\".  The constant search for this elusive “feeling” ultimately leaves people feeling empty. Yet, instead, those who experience a form of joy only found in times of hardship, selflessness, or personal sacrifice are not left empty, but rather experience something truly lasting. By specifically analyzing culture and socio-economic aspects of life, there exists a growing chasm between a life filled with moments of happiness and a life dependent on joy.    \n",

      "Grasping happiness:\n",
      " \n",
      "Is it something innately within us, like an instinct, that drives us toward seeking a moment of happiness at all cost? Many Americans believe happiness is a basic human right, something wildly attainable, something readily available. We believe that with hard work or the right connections or the correct address or education, more happiness awaits just ahead. Yet along with this set of beliefs comes several universal questions: What is happiness? How can I assure my life-long happiness? And, is happiness really for everyone no matter their passport?  Ruut Veenhoven from Erasmus University Rotterdam, believes “happiness is a psychological surface phenomenon, which is at best a far cry from the real good” (Veenhoven 2). His research discusses happiness as a temporary high: once we receive something we truly desire, like a brand new car or house, that satisfaction only lasts momentarily, and once that desire is fulfilled, we simply desire another something of equal or greater value.  One way of feeding unhappiness may be to simply fill-up with something desired—thus, the instant popularity of Amazon delivery—anything delivered in 24-48 hours with a Prime membership. However, Veenhoven writes in his book, The Conditions of Happiness, that striving to be happy is “a far cry from real well-being” and that is where the chasm is exposed as we then try to define the idea of  “well-being” existing separately from simply being happy (Veenhoven 3). Humanity desires happiness, yet happiness is only temporary, and with such constant want of something new, we feel the rise and fall of emotions—desire, loss of desire, emptiness—and thus, left to wonder if we are fully living.\n",
      " \n",
      "Pure joy, next level:\n",
      " \n",
      "            One of the hardest concepts to grasp is the emotion of pure joy. The emotion seems entangled or synonymous with happiness and yet, pure joy may not actually involve being happy at all. For example, take the old grandmother, normally lonely doing the same thing day-in-and day-out suffering from arthritis, collecting her social security check for food. Yet she still says she doesn’t want any Christmas gifts because seeing her grandchildren open their gifts is all the joy she needs for the entire year. Is that moment watching her grandkids being happy a temporary emotion or is it a deep satisfaction that all is well in her family’s life, which in turn eases worry, reminds her of her priorities? Douglas Abrams, the co-author of Have You Renounced Pleasure?, defines the difference between being happy and having joy by stressing that one is connected to the other: “When we speak of experiencing happiness, we need to know there are actually two kinds. The first is the enjoyment of pleasure through our senses” and the other is experiencing “...happiness at a deeper level through our mind, such as love, compassion, generosity” (Abrams 53). To have pure joy means we require a; “deeper level of thinking” this “deeper level” requires a divergence from one’s comfort zone or a challenge that may cause pain. Society must understand that “while joy of the senses is brief, the joy at this deeper level is much longer lasting.  It is true joy” (Abrams 53). The old grandmother witnessing a deeper joy with her family is not focused on her temporary senses of pleasure, but rather on the memory of her husband, or a life fully lived, or the past dreams she once dreamed and are now fulfilled.  When someone returns to a memory of a time they felt love, it may have started out as happiness, but once the emotion is challenged, learns to endure in tough times, the memory of love turns from temporary happiness to a deepened joy, an enduring and permanent understanding.  \n",

      "Culture and satisfaction:\n",
      " \n",
      "Why is it that people in first-world-countries believe they are happier than those who live in the developing world?  Maybe it is innately human to view money or race or skin color as a sign of happiness. If money buys food, and food helps someone live another day, then money buys happiness because living with food should make someone more happy than dying of starvation. Or at least that train-of-thought sounds logical and would imply that all people in America are happier than all people in Uganda—untrue. Is it possible that what makes people happy in one country causes unhappiness in another? For instance, in Western societies, one’s income is considered important to one’s happiness as people truly believe it’s realistic to live in perpetual throws of endless happiness ingrained in us at such a young age—Santa, Easter Bunny, and Tooth Fairy are all designed to insure happiness to a child for the day or the hour.  Disney characters always live their ‘happily-ever-after’ and these fairy-tale endings inevitably brainwash the first world into believing there’s a fairy-tale ending for everyone. Yet, when there is not a fairy-tale ending, what’s the alternative? Unhappiness? Abram’s comments on the state of young people in the first-world by saying “so that’s why their satisfaction is very limited and brief” (Abrams 53). The root cause and conflict of searching for happiness around every corner or searching for a satisfaction that sustains our lives is a fruitless effort. \n",
      "As a former Ugandan street kid myself, I didn’t grow-up watching attractive, yet unrealistic stories until I was at least eight years old. Before someone brought a Disney movie to Kampala, Uganda, I looked forward to playing with my friends, not hoping or expecting the next best thing to fulfill me. I wondered instead if I was going to eat that day and when I did eat, how much more fun the dancing was that night. But when relief did arrive, there was a joy, a deep satisfaction that life is good and as long as we don’t have Malaria, we enjoy. Adam Alter, writer of Do the Poor Have Meaningful Lives? says, “people from poor countries tend to view their lives as more meaningful” because they are not brainwashed by what they watch on television. I agree whole-heartedly. A life lived seeing people have more stuff, more moments of laughing, more comfort, leads to more desire to fill sadness or discomfort with temporary things. Yet, Americans brought us shoes and told us we were poor, ironically ushering in temporary happiness, and simultaneously a reduction of joy. In reflection, I only remember the great moments like eating chicken on Christmas or having a warm soda for the first time, and of course, my best friends. Our lack of television led us toward a life of love and caring for one another, which in turn has led to my life having a deeper appreciation for simple things like a drinking fountain—water just flows out of the wall with literally no effort, and yet at my school, no one, absolutely no one, considers that happiness or joy—yet, it is both!\n",
      " \n",
      "Socio-economic factors and our satisfaction:\n",
      "            My American grandmother says, “money can’t buy you happiness, but it sure is nice to have when you need it.”  Greed then twists this concept into acquiring as much wealth ‘just in case we need it’? Pop culture acknowledges daily the difference between the crazed Kardashians and the rapper, Notorious B.I.G.’s song Mo Money Mo Problems; “I don't know what they want from me / It's like the more money we come across / The more problems we see.” In these simple lyrics even B.I.G. expresses his dissatisfaction with growing wealth and popularity—why is that?  Did he not initially believe his life would be better, happier, more fulfilled if he could simply rise-up as a pop culture icon?   \n",
      "Does the fundamental belief in making more money not lead to the belief that we can have enough money to then take the time to find our true joy—painting or traveling or volunteering at a soup kitchen? The American Dream seems to allude to the fact that if we make enough money to not think about money, then can we live a life of deep satisfaction and joy. Bill Gates appears to be living a life of deep satisfaction as he continues to fund life-changing human dilemmas, but there’s no-telling that he does not simultaneously live riddled with guilt from knowing he has so much while others starve or die of curable diseases like Malaria—again, another chasm widens between a life of joy and a life of intense responsibility. In her Forbes article, “This Harvard Study Says the Happiest People Have More Time and Less Money”, Brianna Wiest discusses the optimal salary of an American.  She claims that when one makes too much (ie. Bill Gates), it leads to stress, a version of unhappiness; and if one makes too little, it also leads to stress and unhappiness. She explores the perfect scenario by analyzing the Gallup Institute data. Wiest says there’s a clear pattern as “people who have enough time are happier, less depressed, experience more joy, exercise more, eat better, are more productive, and are less likely to get divorced.” Their discovery is directly linked to economic incomes with “magic number being $75,000” and  some even believe the number is a bit lower, maybe closer to $50,000 since “when you jump from say $10,000 to $50,000, you notice a marked difference in your quality of life” and that “quality of life: changes to things that might bring happiness for a certain time”(Wiest). But somehow, the salary of $75,000 is the magic number for quality of life not being too much to dream outside of what one requires: pay the bills, yet not live in the stress of lower incomes which leads to lack of healthcare, etc. If this magic number is true, people need to be aware before they too suffer the great downfall of mankind—the drive to make money at all costs. \n",
      " \n",
      "Conclusion:\n",
      "Humanity wakes-up everyday with a road map of choices: live by joy and seek enduring satisfaction, or live a life of happiness by filling days with temporary pleasures like a pretty outfit or popularity. By these simplified definitions, we thoroughly see the chasm between the two, but can we easily choose one or the other? Accordingly, we know that joy needs happiness to exist. However, does happiness require joy to exist? For example, to have a memory worth holding onto forever, turning into an enduring joy, one must have a happy moment along the way no matter how fleeting; thus, proving that a simple daily road map of choice is more complex. And, if everyone's efforts are focused on trying to be happy, they inevitably miss the point to life. Instead of chasing unrealistic levels of happiness, and no matter our passport or race or skin color, we should be in search of deep satisfactions flowing out of joy, fully aware that the equal and opposite emotion of happiness is self-inflicted unhappiness. Therefore, enjoy the simple moments of happiness as they come while living fully-aware that too much of them may destroy their ability to one day be enduring joy. \n",

      "Riots through a different lens\n",
      "Viewing civil unrest as a symptom of systemic oppression, not a tool to combat it\n",
      "\n",
      "Riots have marked America since the country’s very beginning. Perhaps one most notably sewn into the fabric of American history is the Boston Massacre, in which British troops fired on a crowd of American protestors in a city fraught with tensions over British tax laws. Other notable riots in American history include the New York Draft Riots and Haymarket Square Riot, both in response to work-related grievances in the mid to late 19th century; the Zoot Suit Riots of 1943 during which white military personnel targeted black, Filipino, and Mexican men in Los Angeles; and the famous Stonewall Riots in 1969, when police and club-goers clashed outside of a gay bar, paving the way for LGBTQ+ rights. Race-related riots have also been frequent, many occurring as a reaction to police violence. These include the Stono Rebellion, the riots of the Red Summer of 1919, the Detroit Riots in 1967, and the Los Angeles Riots in response to the acquittal of the officers who beat Rodney King.\n",
      "\n",
      "These riots did not appear out of thin air. Widespread anger is rarely baseless—communities full of comfortably employed people with full bellies do not see the collective rage and violence that marks periods of civil unrest. But are riots effective in combating the issues from which they stem? The issue is hotly contested—there is evidence to suggest that they often economically harm the communities in which they occur, while there are also historical examples of their success, including the riots after MLK’s death that led to the passing of groundbreaking civil rights legislation in the form of the Fair Housing Act of 1968.\n",
      "\n",
      "This past summer has seen many riots catalyzed by the killing of George Floyd, reigniting the debate over the effectiveness of violence and looting in bringing about change. Those opposed to the Black Lives Matter movement often cite property damage and Martin Luther King Jr.’s tactics to prove that peaceful protest is the only “right” way to fight oppression, while supporters of BLM argue that the riots have led to victories within the movement, including the reopening of Elijah McClain’s case and banning of no-knock warrants in various states following the death of Breonna Taylor.\n",
      "\n",
      "But while both of these views see riots as either effective or ineffective solutions to a problem, riots shouldn’t be seen as a potential solution at all—rather, they are the inevitable, very human reaction to state-condoned violence and oppression and should be treated as an indication to tackle underlying problems instead of as a means to do so. \n",
      "\n",
      "Riots are not, as many believe, mindless, unfocused mob rule—they are the mobilization of many individuals who share a common enemy or cause and who take to the streets for their movement specifically. When a riot takes place, group polarization and anonymity come into play—that is, people lose their sense of self when in a crowd of like-minded people, leading them to make more extreme decisions. All that is necessary to start a riot is underlying rage and frustration and a catalyst, like a blaze beginning with just a pile of tinder and a spark. In the case of the recent surge in the BLM movement, the tinder is the anger within the black community built up over centuries of systemic racism, like a powder keg pressurized to the point of explosion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Humiliation is a recurring theme within this anger. There is humiliation in being slammed over the hood of a car by a police officer as your white counterparts stand by, untouched. There is humiliation in being denied a job just for having an African American-sounding name, in growing up and always seeing people with your skin color relegated to the roles of villains and sidekicks. There is humiliation in being the only person with your skin color in a boardroom, in listening to a backhanded compliment from a coworker that you “speak so well for someone like you,” in feeling the burning stares of white classmates who have never seen hair like yours. There is humiliation in repeated embarrassment and rejection within white society of your personhood, and there is humiliation every time you have to convince someone that your pain exists.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those who condemn the riots yet claim to support the BLM movement in all other aspects miss the frustration at the very heart of the black community. The riots are a symptom of widespread oppression, and denying their validity denies the right of black Americans to be angry at their own oppression and mistreatment and to express themselves in accordance with that rage. \n",
      "Attempting to label riots as effective or ineffective treats them as a political tool, but that perspective completely misses what riots are: a natural response to generations of pent up anger and dehumanization. When someone cries out after their arm is broken, they do not believe their own cry will get them to the hospital or heal their injury—they are simply reacting, responding naturally as a human who feels pain. Pain within the black community stretches back centuries, and it runs far deeper than a broken arm, weaving itself through the nerves and sinews of society like a disease that has been allowed to ravage this country for far too long. \n",
      "\n",
      "Many condemn one type of violence while ignoring the other—that is, systemic, state-sanctioned violence whose victims respond with their own fervent defense. Slavery is violence. The war on drugs is violence. Police brutality is violence. Redlining, segregation, mass incarceration, racial achievement gaps, and microaggressions are violence. Yes, riots are violence too, but they occur at the other end of the balance of power, an outcry among African Americans over scales that are so overwhelmingly stacked against them. Author Ta-Nehisi Coates wrote eloquently in 2015 in response to the Baltimore Riots about the government’s response to civil unrest: \n",
      "When nonviolence is preached as an attempt to evade the repercussions of political brutality, it betrays itself. When nonviolence begins halfway through the war with the aggressor calling time out, it exposes itself as a ruse. When nonviolence is preached by the representatives of the state, while the state doles out heaps of violence to its citizens, it reveals itself to be a con. And none of this can mean that rioting or violence is \"correct\" or \"wise,\" any more than a forest fire can be \"correct\" or \"wise.\" Wisdom isn't the point tonight. Disrespect is. In this case, disrespect for the hollow law and failed order that so regularly disrespects the community.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is an attempt by many, often those who have the most to lose should widespread civil unrest overturn the existing social hierarchy, to channel the anger evident in riots into more manageable outlets. Peaceful protest is lauded as the only way to achieve equality—even though peaceful protest is often met with similar discontent—because peaceful protest does much less to destabilize the status quo than does rioting. The founding fathers feared “mobocracy” as much as current politicians and CEOs fear the looting of a Target, and those in power have influenced large parts of the public into fearing their own collective power.  \n",
      "Riots shouldn’t be measured by their “productivity,” by the laws passed or cases resolved in their wake. Riots shouldn’t be seen as a tool for fighting oppression, or a replacement for the widespread reorganization of society that is needed to combat systemic racism. Riots should be observed and reported on, rioters acknowledged as human beings exercising their right to feel angry over mistreatment, and underlying causes of riots seeked out and addressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Kerner Commission, a report identifying poverty, unemployment, voter suppression, violent policing, and other forms of institutionalized racism as major causes behind the unrest in cities across America during the summer of 1967, states, “What the rioters appeared to be seeking was fuller participation in the social order and the material benefits enjoyed by the majority of American citizens. Rather than rejecting the American system, they were anxious to obtain a place for themselves in it.” All non-black Americans should be examining and working to dismantle the institutions that keep our black brothers and sisters from enjoying the opportunities we are afforded, not berating them for demanding their rightful seat at the table. \n",
      "\n",
      "Malcolm X once said, “You can’t separate peace from freedom because no one can be at peace unless he has his freedom.” This has been echoed in recent chants from the BLM movement of “No justice, no peace.” As long as oppression continues, riots are inevitable. Perhaps what is to be most feared is not the riots themselves, but a world in which black Americans do not riot in response to the killing of their family members on the streets, the locking up and exploitation of their brothers and fathers, and the continued weight of chains that have yet to be lifted. \n",

      "Dear Governor DeWine,\n",
      "     I am writing to you about the unveiling of your “Strong Ohio” bill this past October. In your announcement of the bill, you explain that the inclusion of red-flag laws and universal background checks in your proposal would be ineffective given the stance of most republican congressmen. I agree with your reasoning that this bill is much more likely to pass in the Ohio General Assembly than a bill that includes a “red-flag” gun seizure law; this strategic move is likely to appeal to many republicans and does not largely take away from the effectiveness of the bill. Additionally, I agree with your assessment that the bill still has the potential to save lives without the integration of these clauses. Provisions such as increased penalties and punishments for crimes such as selling guns to minors, selling or providing guns to someone legally prohibited from possessing a gun, and illegally having a firearm in one's possession are a step in the right direction. Furthermore, the addition of “pink slip” laws that provide court-ordered treatment to those suffering from mental health disorders and drug and alcohol addictions before a mandatory probate court hearing allows the court to remove guns from the possession of those who are a danger to themselves or others. However, I believe that your decision to omit universal background checks in an attempt to make the bill more legislature-friendly has significantly undermined many of the bill’s preventative measures. While the “Strong Ohio” Bill contains gun control advancements that would be an improvement from what currently exists in Ohio, the absence of universal background checks renders many of the bill’s proposals ineffective. I would like you to consider the possibility of implementing these preventative measures in your gun control policy.\n",
      "     Although the odds of a person dying due to a mass shooting in the U.S. are only one in 11,125 (which is still the 32nd most common cause of death), the probability that a person will die of assault by gun is one in 315, making gun violence a leading cause of death in America (Gould and Mosher). Though I have, fortunately, never been directly impacted by gun violence, my lack of experience does not influence my ability to understand the seriousness of the situation. Out of the 65 shooting-related incidents at schools this year, 36 of them occurred at high schools (“Incidents by School”). As a high school student, the issue of gun violence and how it can be prevented is very important to me. Tragedies like the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida have shown that the U.S.’s laws can not protect school-aged children and teenagers. As we are affected by the lack of gun control and effective safety measures in America, we have no choice but to participate in gun reform discussions and debates to improve our own safety. In addition to school shootings, firearm-related suicide is another issue affecting teens. Over 1,000 children and teens’ lives are lost each year due to firearm suicide, a rate that has increased 82% over the past ten years (“Firearm Suicide”). In addition to problematically high suicide rates, gun-related homicide is another leading cause of death in teenagers: “Annually, nearly 2,900 children and teens (ages 0 to 19) are shot and killed, and nearly 15,600 are shot and injured—that’s an average of 51 American young people every day” (“Impact of Gun Violence”). However, the impact of gun violence on America’s younger generation goes beyond direct wounds. Everytown for Gun Safety Support Fund estimates that “about 3 million children witness a shooting each year” (“Impact”). Oftentimes incidents like these occur without warning when they are least expected. \n",
      "     On August 4th in Dayton, Ohio, a gunman killed nine people, including his own sister, and injured 24 others in the 30 seconds it took for police to take him down (Martin). The massacre occurred in an open area called the Oregon District where many people go to enjoy dinner and live music. One of the victims, 25-year-old Nick Cumer, had been out celebrating his new job offer at the Maple Tree Cancer Alliance before he and his friends were brutally murdered (Allyn). As you and the Mayor of Dayton, Nan Whaley, attended a vigil following the shooting, crowds of people demanded that you do something about the lack of legislation protecting Ohioans from gun violence. In an interview with Cleveland.com, you referred to your own bill as better than the alternative of “doing nothing” (Darcy). While this may be true, it is an unbelievably low standard to aim for. When dealing with the possibility of more innocent people like Nick dying prematurely due to gun violence, a bill that is “better than nothing” is not good enough. Additionally, since the bill does not create a requirement for background checks on private gun sales, there is a large loophole that criminals can still use to acquire weapons. In fact, “Around 80% of all firearms acquired for criminal purposes are obtained through transfers from unlicensed sellers, and 96% of inmates convicted of gun offenses who were already prohibited from possessing a firearm at the time of the offense obtained their firearm from an unlicensed seller” (“Universal”). Due to this discrepancy, it is unlikely that the bill’s implementation of an optional “seller protection certificate”, which can be requested from sheriffs’ offices to prove to sellers that one has passed a background check, will be effective. While the bill provides an incentive for sellers not to sell firearms to those who do not have seller protection certificates, there is no guarantee that transactions without them won’t happen. Instead of stopping the problem at the root with universal background checks, The “Strong Ohio” bill waits for the criminal to acquire the gun, possibly commit the crime, and then punishes the buyer and the seller with harsher sentences once they are caught.\n",
      "Although the removal of “red-flag” laws from this bill was a logical decision, the additional elimination of a universal background check policy was unnecessary and ill-advised. \n",
      "     A recent Quinnipiac University poll shows that 90% of Ohioans support universal background checks for all gun buyers (“Ohio Voters”). This widespread support includes both gun owners and non-gun owners. Statistics have shown that, overall, even the most pro-gun citizens of the U.S. support background check laws: “Strong support for background check laws has also been measured among NRA members, with at least 69% supporting comprehensive background checks” (“Universal”). These perspectives were not adequately taken into consideration when determining whether his bill would be able to pass Ohio’s legislature. While it is clear that Republican House Speaker Larry Householder is going to be a challenge to persuade to support this bill, it appears that he and most other Republicans are mainly concerned about the possibility of “red-flag” laws being put into practice. Both lawmakers like Householder and officials such as Dean Rieck of the Buckeye Firearms Association were particularly concerned about the idea of gun seizure and are now pleased to see that the bill doesn’t have a “red-flag” law, if still harboring a few reservations about the proposals. According to Lieutenant Governor Jon Husted, a red-flag law would be “inadequate and unworkable” due to the extensive amount of time it would require, resulting in the endangerment of both the person in question and law enforcement (Kasler and Ingles). However, the same issue cannot be said for universal background checks; they have proved to be both efficient and effective: “In at least 90% of cases, firearm background checks processed through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) are resolved immediately” (“Universal”). Most importantly, the positive impact of implementing universal background checks outweighs all shortcomings and difficulties that it would require to pass the law. It has been shown that states without background check laws are significantly more unsafe than those that utilize them: “States without universal background check laws export crime guns across state lines at a 30% higher rate than states that require background checks on all gun sales” (“Universal”). Eliminating the loophole in our gun control laws that most criminals exploit to obtain firearms is worth the extra time and effort it would take to convince the Ohio legislature of its importance. \n",
      "     While at first glance the “Strong Ohio” Bill seems like a solid, if slightly subdued, approach to improving gun control in Ohio, its power is significantly diminished by the lack of a universal background check law. Your choice to exclude this safety measure from your gun control policy fails to extinguish the method by which the majority of criminals acquire weapons. Although the bill would put certain punishments in place to encourage private sellers not to sell firearms to those without background checks, this approach to the problem is backwards and doesn’t target the issue directly enough to prevent it from occurring in the future. The welfare of Ohioans is worth more than a bill that just barely improves our gun control laws in an attempt to please calls for reform in the wake of the latest mass shooting or other firearm-related tragedy. Nationwide and in Ohio, gun owners and non-gun owners alike support the use of universal background checks to assure the protection of innocent people from gun violence. While it is clear that passing a less conservative bill in the Ohio legislature will be difficult, we can do so with enough support. It is essential that Ohioans who want a safer future for their state voice their support for the implementation of universal background checks into Ohio’s gun control policy. However, it is also the job of the state government to listen to what the people are saying and act accordingly. For the sake of all Ohioans, I urge you to include universal background checks in your gun control policy.\n",

      "The Cycle of Dehumanization and Disenfranchisement Within America’s Prison System\n",
      " \n",
      "Despite having just under 5% of the world’s population, the United States houses 22% of the world’s prisoners.[i] It is a statistic often repeated when discussing prison reform, and for good reason; the “land of the free,” for all of its boasts about possibility and equality of opportunity, has the highest incarceration rate in the world at 698 per 100,000, a burden that falls disproportionately on blacks and Hispanics.[ii] These statistics seem to indicate a country struggling to maintain order and contain a slew of criminals, but since 1991, the violent crime rate has fallen substantially, while the number of people incarcerated has increased by 50%.[iii] There is something fundamentally wrong with how we operate our prisons, something fundamentally wrong with a system that locks up millions of people each year yet has “liberty and justice for all” in its pledge. Do we truly believe that those millions deserve their place behind bars, that the label of criminal constitutes treatment oftentimes unbelievably cruel? The American prison industrial complex traps individuals in a cycle of incarceration that is rooted in poverty and perpetuated by trauma and disadvantages accrued behind bars—it is a system that emphasizes punishment over rehabilitation in a way that denies the potential of people to better themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "The path to prison lays its initial brickwork in the poorest neighborhoods of America, where a vicious cycle of poor education, unemployment, debt, and violence traps people in poverty and drives them towards crime. These communities, largely with high black populations due to the pervasive effects of segregation and economic disenfranchisement, lack the tools key in determining an individual’s success. In an environment so devoid of opportunities, children struggle from the onset—30% of children living in poverty do not earn a GED, which makes them 3.5 times more likely to be arrested than their counterparts who finish high school.[iv] A bad education then hinders people from finding jobs, and extremely poor neighborhoods see an unemployment rate among working-age men nearly 20 percentage points higher than the national average.[v] Higher rates of violent crime plague these areas, and they funnel straight into the prison system for many; the pre-incarceration earnings of incarcerated people are 41% lower than that of their similarly-aged, non-incarcerated counterparts.[vi] With no other options, some turn to crime simply to survive, lacking the luxury of choice with which those born into better circumstances are privileged. \n",
      "\n",
      "The strong links between poverty and crime are intuitive: those in desperate situations will turn to more drastic measures to support themselves, taking actions that would not be necessary for someone who can afford to feed their family, pay for healthcare, or resolve their debts. There is a certain stigma attached to poverty in a country that, according to many, affords equality of opportunity to all. When someone has failed, it is seen as a failure of the individual to make use of their resources and pull themselves up by their bootstraps, but with almost 40 million Americans living in poverty, it may be more apt to conclude that poverty, and by extension crime, are failures of society.[vii] The individual is burdened with racial, class, and gender wealth gaps established long before they are even born. But the wide disparities within this country have not been met with concerted efforts to lift people out of poverty and tackle crime at its root—instead, an industry has sprung up, one worth billions that throws people behind bars as a punishment for their desperation.\n",
      "\n",
      "America’s prison system maintains an environment that can only be described as cruel and unusual, an environment largely focused on punishment and hostile to individuals hoping to turn their life around. Solitary confinement, claimed as torture by the UN, is a practice used routinely by prisons wherein a prisoner can be held alone in a cell for 22-24 hours per day, with devastating effects: heightened risk of panic, anxiety, rage, depression, hallucinations, and suicide.[viii] Additionally, psychological distress, cramped conditions, and idle time caused by short staffing, overcrowding, and the cutting of rehabilitation programs make violence commonplace.[ix] Mika’il DeVeaux describes a sickening instance of violence he witnessed while serving 32 years behind bars:\n",
      "I still see the image of a person being hit at the base of his skull with a baseball bat on a warm, sunny afternoon during recreation hours. The entire scene plays like a silent movie. He is smashed in the back of his head, crumbles, and falls to the ground. While he lays helpless on the ground, his head is smashed again and again until the sight of blood seems to satisfy his attacker. I watch as the perpetrator then calmly returns the baseball bat to the location where he had retrieved it and just walks away as if nothing had happened, while others entering the yard area walk around the lifeless body.[x]\n",
      "It would be naive to imagine someone witnessing such a horrifying situation, one that plagues their memory years later, will leave completely unscathed. This violence may be seen as a result of what some deem as the “natural tendencies” of criminals, but in actuality, it stems from the dehumanization of people and neglect of their needs. When people are treated like animals—when they are battered and made to feel as if they mean nothing to the outside world—they will naturally respond to their suffocating circumstances, whether it be through violence, complete withdrawal from their fellow prisoners, mental deterioration, or something far worse. 10-25% of US prisoners suffer from a serious mental illness in contrast to 4.6% of total US adults.[xi] Rates of PTSD, paranoia, panic attacks, and depression are higher among inmates, as are the rates of chronic physical ailments such as diabetes, hypertension, and asthma.[xii] America’s prisons make the already weak weaker, responding to pain not with treatment but with trauma. They do not “whip people into shape”—they damage people further, making those who are broken less likely to ever find success or happiness. This is a far cry from rehabilitation, something that has become more of a luxury than a right.\n",
      "\n",
      "And punishment does not end upon release. Once someone leaves their distressing situation behind bars, they enter a world in which their label subjugates them to the role of a second-class citizen, burdened by institutional discrimination and stigma to the point of ostracization even by friends and family. Felons can lose their voting rights while incarcerated and/or during a period after in most states, and in eleven states they lose their voting rights indefinitely or must go through extra steps to regain them.[xiii] Additionally, many former prisoners fall right back into poverty and unemployment, with just 52.6% of prisoners employed six months after their release and almost half making less than $500 annually one year after they leave the system.[xiv] If these wealth disparities sound familiar, that is because they are almost identical to the situation many felons find themselves in before they are incarcerated—the position of desperation and frustration that pushed them into crime in the first place. But now they face the additional stigma of being an ex-con, which can affect employment (a criminal record reduces the likelihood of a callback or job offer by nearly 50%, with the negative effects more heavily falling on black people), access to food stamps (drug traffickers subject to a ban on food stamps in Florida were about 9% more likely return to prison than those who had access to SNAP), and family stability (children with an incarcerated father are more likely to be incarcerated themselves).[xv] These burdens, which haunt felons long after they have served their time, destroy communities and only worsen the difficult circumstances that breed crime. People inevitably end up back in the system, and their children end up in the system, and so do their children’s children, until entire families have been sapped of their potential and robbed of what little wealth they had to begin with. America’s criminal justice system extends punishment far past someone’s release date, ensuring they will never get to start anew and perpetuating a cruel cycle that traps historically disenfranchised individuals within its jaws.\n",
      "\n",
      "This system thrives off of fear. It capitalizes on our fear of the “other,” dehumanizing criminals in an attempt to divide us and justify harsher treatment within penitentiaries. Incarcerated individuals have their identities flattened, defined by their crimes and demonized by sensationalized depictions of them in the media. Murder accounts for just 2% of all crimes in urban areas and a mere 0.1% in the suburbs, yet murder cases take up 36% of the air time among all crimes reported on the TV news, leading viewers to believe prison is filled with killers when in reality it is populated largely by people convicted on nonviolent, often drug-related charges. Dramatic depictions of prisons in TV shows represent prisoners as violent, 2D characters who only serve to be apprehended by the hero cop or detective to then be cast aside, the circumstances surrounding their crime and aftermath of their conviction ignored. This exaggeration is entertaining for viewers and profitable for showrunners, and it largely targets blacks and Latinos. Fiction and reality tend to blend together in viewers’ minds, and these graphic and largely untrue depictions of prisoners help to justify increasingly harsh forms of punishment and policing.[xvi] \n",
      "\n",
      "This rhetoric is pervasive and dangerous. We all tend to have compassion for our fellow human beings, but that fades as we are led to no longer see some as human beings. Criminals are reduced to their crimes—a single instant of their life defines them, obscuring any past hardships or future achievements, crushing their entire life story into one bad decision. I would kill for my kids, said by many parents and with great sincerity behind the words, can also take the form of, I would steal for my kids. I would cash a fraudulent check for my kids. I would fake my address to ensure that my kids get a good education. What separates a criminal from a noncriminal, the inside of a prison from the world beyond? Maybe it is just that instant when a would turns into a did, when someone is pushed to crime by the overwhelming desperation of their circumstances. It is easier to lock up a “murderer” than someone with a name. It is easier to lock up a “burglar” than a single father, an “illegal alien” (a phrase dehumanizing in the bluntest way) than a mother fleeing gang violence. No one’s story is one night, one instant, one mistake. To quote Bryan Stevenson, a lawyer for death row inmates and author of Just Mercy, “We are not the worst thing we’ve ever done.”[xvii] Imagine your life depicted in a series of polaroids, stacks upon stacks of snapshots of everything action, every decision from which your life is constructed. What if someone were to pick up a single polaroid, or even a handful, and formulate their entire opinion of you based on what they see? We need to remind ourselves that someone’s complexity cannot possibly be reduced to a single label, and we must work to dismantle a system that uses such a small factor to determine how someone will live out the rest of their life.\n",
      "\n",
      "There must be a better way to operate prisons—and in fact, there are proven ways to treat prisoners that benefit both them and greater society. Norway’s prison system, for example, is seen as a pinnacle of prison design and stands in sharp contrast to that of the US—large windows instead of bleak walls and stacks of books instead of empty exercise yards. With an incarceration rate nine times lower than that of the US and a 20% recidivism rate (the number of people who reoffend) compared to America’s 76.6%, Norway focuses on restorative justice, which aims to repair the harm caused by a crime rather than punish prisoners. Norwegian prisons maintain a sense of normalcy with the outside world, which is thought to better help prisoners reintegrate into society. Relinquishing of freedom is seen as punishment enough, and rehabilitation is emphasized. This alternative way of organizing prisons stems from the determination to see the good in people, recognizing their potential to improve and giving them the tools with which they can do so.[xviii]\n",
      "\n",
      "Though it is unlikely the US will be switching to the Norwegian model anytime soon, many programs already implemented in American prisons have yielded promising results. Education programs, for example, have been shown to reduce recidivism rates across the board—in Indiana, by as much as 44% for those who complete college degrees during their time incarcerated than those who do not. The Correctional Association of New York commends educational programs for “providing an incentive for good behavior; producing mature, well-spoken leaders who have a calming influence on other [incarcerated people] and on correction officers; and communicating the message that society has sufficient respect for the human potential of incarcerated people.” Educational programs work by framing prisoners as students with the ability to learn and improve, allowing inmates to take advantage of the opportunities provided and do just that.[xix]\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps a less conventional though also highly effective approach takes the form of inmate arts programs. Feedback from programs in Florida and California reported that participating inmates gained a greater sense of self and accomplishment, as well as benefits from working as part of a team that could be applied life after release; recidivism rates also reduced and inmates enrolled in the program recorded considerably fewer disciplinary actions. Inmates in Risdon Prison’s Create program in Australia reported that they felt a sense of belonging, enjoyed having a place to explore ideas and do something with a purpose, and developed a relationship with the outside world and authority figures that was not hierarchical.

      "There are a wide range of rehabilitation programs employed in prisons across the world, but the one thing they all have in common is that they recognize the shared humanity and redeemability of prisoners, concepts that are all too often lost amidst prisoners’ violent portrayal in society. Perhaps this shared humanity is most evident in the small moments: another hour spent in the library analyzing Macbeth, just like a high school student two miles down the road; working through a traumatic experience with a counselor who also treats patients from the “outside world”; a step taken back to admire a mural in the same way as an art student at the local community college. The biggest mistake we make when discussing the prison industrial complex and its devastating grip on the lives of millions of Americans is forgetting that each and every person behind bars has so much more to give to society, their loved ones, and themselves. \n",
      "\n",
      "I propose venturing to an unusual place to find inspiration with which to proceed when reforming our prisons. The Good Place, a TV show that explores ideas of morality and humanity as it follows four people along their journey through the afterlife, concludes with the optimistic sentiment that humans have the extraordinary capacity to better themselves when given the means to do so. Two quotes from one character, Michael, are worth sharing:\n",
      "“The point is, people improve when they get external love and support. How can we hold it against them when they don’t?”[xxi] \n",
      "“What matters isn’t if people are good or bad. What matters is if they’re trying to be better today than they were yesterday. You asked me where my hope comes from? That’s my answer.”[xxii] \n",
      "There is a fundamental disconnect between how the prison system operates and the incredible tenacity, compassion, and goodness of human beings. People want to make an honest living; they want to provide for their families and be good citizens and help others succeed. But people sometimes make bad decisions, especially when put into situations that are neither fair nor equally distributed. The American prison system does not try to correct these decisions or the inequities that influence them, instead aiming to punish people brutally and without relent.\n",
      "\n",
      "This may all seem overwhelming: the scale of the problem, the sheer number of individuals crushed beneath its weight, the vise grip it has on our society. But America’s prison system cannot be allowed to continue in its current state, with its appalling treatment of those trapped within it. Prisoners are people, people with families and struggles and a past, but most importantly people with a future yet unwritten; we have the power to determine whether someone reaches their full potential in the future by pushing for reform here and now. Change must happen, but change can be slow, imperceptible, taking form in the smallest of ways yet making the most incredible of differences. Change begins within us, with how we choose to view others, listen, extend forgiveness. We are all human beings, yet we let a wall separate who we think is deserving of love and respect from who we allow to be cast aside. Humanity is strengthened by cooperation, made all the more complete by the shared traits we can recognize and defend within each other. Chidi Anagonye, another character from The Good Place, puts this thought most beautifully: “I argue that we choose to be good because of our bonds with other people and our innate desire to treat them with dignity. Simply put, we are not in this alone.”[xxiii] We must fulfill our responsibilities to our fellow humans, on both sides of the bars, to find the strength to empathize and understand, to forgive and heal. Only then can we truly pursue a world that is more just, a society that sees the potential in all its members, filled with citizens who are connected through their shared desire to be better for each other and who give others the opportunity to become better for them.\n",

      "             As a Black girl, my hair is in a constant state of metamorphosis. I’ve been around the proverbial block; I’ve sported butt-length box braids, passion twists suitable for a vacation to the Dominican Republic, every wig in the Beauty Supply Store, twist-outs, braid-outs, all of it. But the hairstyle that is the most polarizing, most feared, and most misunderstood, (and, let’s face it: the most fun) is the afro. When I wear my afro, the cashier at Whole Foods will say “Right on!” or my classmate will throw up a Black Power fist in solidarity. Some passersby veer out of the way of my towering tresses. Some grip their wallets until their knuckles are white. Most just stare. \n",
      "            So what is the afro? Is it a marker of old-school blackness? A statement? The preferred ‘do’ of revolutionaries, the salon-equivalent of a bloody grenade? Or is it just African hair in its natural state, unassuming and uninhibited? \n",
      "            It took me seventeen years to understand why something as trivial as my hair made people trip all over themselves or say the wrong thing. What I had to realize was that my hair wasn't trivial at all.  \n",
      "            I had to realize that afro-textured hair, as we have it now, was only made possible through three revolutions. Four, if you include my own.\n",
      "           New Orleans in the 1700s is a melting pot of French and Spanish settlers, as well as people of African, Caribbean, and Creole descent. The air is thick with paprika, sun-dried cayenne peppers, and expensive rouge. Non-European women, dragged from their motherlands and catapulted into the colonial world, try as hard as they can to preserve their complex culture, including the elaborate hairstyles of their ancestors. They braid close to the scalp, wear a variety of buns and top-knots, and adorn their strands with gemstones, beads, and petals (Callender). White women, irked by these showy displays, petition Governor Esteban Rodriquez Miro to do something about the “exotic”, dark-skinned temptresses. \n",
      "            In response, Governor Miro enacts the “Tignon Laws”, which require women of color to wear a tignon, a type of head wrap, to cover their hair. Not only did it shield “unseemly” Black hair from wandering eyes, but it also indicated social status and race (Callender). \n",
      "            Black women, ever inventive, began to wear flamboyant tignons with rich colors that drew even greater attention (Callender). Discomfort with Black hair and Blackness as a whole has existed since the beginning, and since the beginning, we have rebelled.\n",

      "            The 1960s gave way to the second revolution: the Civil Rights Movement. Activists preached the reclamation of every aspect of Blackness, which manifested into the Black Power and Black is Beautiful movements (Gabbara). Self-acceptance, self-actualization, self-governance. Self-love, without apologies, without shame--this was the unifying theme of the multifaceted, often convoluted crusade for civil rights. \n",
      "             Being ‘Black and Proud’ meant being proud of everything to do with Black identity, and at the core of this reclamation was hair. Before the sixties, afro-textured hair was an unrelenting river of shame for African American women. Many used toxic hair-straightening compounds like lye and extreme heat to avoid being branded “nappy”, “wooly”, or “kinky”. But suddenly, college students across the country roamed campus with sky-high afros. Older Black omen let their coils loose. The hot combs, relaxers, and Eurocentric beauty ideals had, momentarily, lost their hold in the Black community. According to Chad Dion Lassiter, president of the Black Men at Penn School of Social Work, Inc., afros were an “outward sign of their frustration toward Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s nonviolent philosophy … the Afro was Black beauty personified without White validation, and it did not care about critics” (Gabbara). For activists, the afro was never “just a hairstyle”; it was an instrument used, in conjunction with their writings, speeches, and protests, to dismantle the system of white supremacy. \n",
      "            To wear naturally afro-textured hair was activism. \n",
      "            With the seventies came another revolution, a different revolution. The afro, which once marked its wearers as ruthless “radicals” and militaristic \"Marxists”, was now worn to discotheques across the country. The Supremes wore afros, the Jackson Five wore afros. The Blaxploitation films of the seventies also played a key role in bringing Black experiences (and hair) into the mainstream (Gabbara). Movies such as Foxy Brown and Coffy, which involved “bad-ass” Black characters usually involved in crime, prostitution, and gambling, pummeled urban audiences with images of African Americans in their “natural” state. The afro became an accessory. \n",
      "           The fourth revolution happened the summer before fifth grade. My mother asked me if I wanted to go natural. I said yes, because it meant that I wouldn’t have to use stinky, painful relaxers anymore. I was ready for slippery, silky, flowing curls, like Zendaya's or Yara Shahidi's. I couldn’t wait.  \n",
      "           As it happens, going natural was not as easy as we thought it would be. My hair, half-relaxed, half-natural, and straight from the motherland, would not yield to wide-tooth combs, extra-strength conditioner, or even sheer force. Washing it took upwards of three hours and blow-drying it made my arms ache. I spent countless afternoons in front of the mirror, face pruned from shampoo or tears or a mixture of both, attacking the kinks on my head. \n",
      "          The only person who hated my hair more than I did was my mother. This wasn’t what we asked for. It wasn’t slippery or silky--it was angry. Neglected.  \n",
      "          Anyone who has ever been a teenager in America, especially a Black teenager, knows the acute melancholy that comes with not liking yourself. I'm not talking about just hating the way your hair falls or the slant of your eyebrows, but looking down at your sneakers in the hallway so you won’t have to meet anyone’s curious gaze, or walking with your shoulders rounded forward like a makeshift shield, or simply trying to not take up so much space. \n",
      "          It took years before I was able to wear my afro out in public. There was no method to the madness, no book out there titled how to make peace with your knotty, kinky hair. So I did my own research. I absorbed the stories of the women who came before me. They taught me to keep my chin up. To square my shoulders. To dance and flirt in the face of contempt. \n",
      "          And when I did let my coils loose, it was like a bloody, arduous war had ended and I had come out the victor. For the first time in my life, I felt like those New Orleans women--stunning, funky, interesting. I took up space. And I didn’t apologize for it. \n",

      "At the Berlin Conference of 1884-1885, all the major European powers (England, France, Belgium, Germany, Portugal, and Italy) convened and “decided” how they would divide up the continent of Africa among themselves; the Congo was “made” the personal property of King Leopold II of Belgium. Over the next decades, Leopold and his fellow Europeans would mercilessly extract resources and people from Africa, but—astoundingly—under the guise of a humanitarian mission: These imperialists professed a desire to “rescue” the “savages” from their ways, to bring “civilization,” and to spread Christianity to the “dark continent.” In his novel Heart of Darkness, Joseph Conrad, a staunch anti-imperialist, offers a critical examination of the discourses underpinning Africa’s colonial exploitation. The protagonist of the novel is Charlie Marlow, who, for most of the novel, is himself narrating the tale of his experiences in the Congo to his fellow crew-mates on a boat in London and, simultaneously, to the reader. Conrad argues that Marlow soon recognizes that European discourses of “progress” simply  aim to obscure the moral horrors taking place under colonial rule. However, Conrad suggests that, when Marlow tries to comprehend these horrors by capturing them in a language-based framework, he fails, and this failure leaves him morally and epistemologically paralyzed. \n",
      "\n",
      "As he describes his arrival in the Congo, Marlow recalls that he soon learned that European colonists’ discourse of “progress” and civilization obscured the true nature of their deeds; however, he implies that, bereft of any explanatory discourse to help him process what he was seeing, he entered—and remains in—a state of psychological and epistemological chaos. Marlow states that, when he saw Africans being forced to work on the company station, the colonists told him they were “criminals” and “enemies” to whom the “outraged law… had come”; he stepped into the “shade”—where, seeing a laborer who was a “dying… shadows of disease and starvation,” he gave him a “biscui[t]”—and, horrified stepped out of the shade and into the presence of a company accountant with “white cuffs” (18-21). By claiming that they were applying the “law” to “criminals,” Marlow implies, the colonists were suggesting that they were on some heroic mission to introduce justice and “progress” to a land of “savages.” But Marlow’s narratorial juxtaposition of the noble language of “law” with the realities he had observed—“dying,” “disease,” and “starvation”—suggests that he was able to see the disjuncture between the colonists’ elevated narratives and the rapaciousness of their actions. He further emphasizes his recognition of this disjuncture by suggesting that he identified the “shade” as the locus of true knowledge, which implies that he—in a disruption of traditional Western black-white binaries—could see that the light and “white[ness]” of the colonists and their discourses represented not enlightenment but concealment. However, the fact that Marlow instinctively stepped out of the “shade” and into the “light” suggests that he felt uncomfortable with this new knowledge and would rather have avoided its disruptive implications. After all, colonial discourses of “progress” and civilization—to which Marlow had presumably been exposed his entire life—might have provided him with the (false) comfort of a language-based framework through which to capture and understand the nature of what he was witnessing. As the narrator, Marlow reveals that—once stripped of the illusions underpinning colonial narratives—he was left to confront the radical horror and otherness of colonial Africa without any explanatory framework to guide him: When he saw the Congolese laborer “dying,” Marlow’s narration suggests, he simply had no means to process what he was seeing, and could therefore do nothing more than give him a “biscui[t].” One could argue that, even at the moment of narration, Marlow remains without any means of comprehending or explaining what he saw in the Congo. That is why he is recounting his experiences—in the hopes of establishing some framework to parse them. \n",
      "\n",
      "Marlow, through the very act of narration, tries to forge a language-based discourse that recognizes and explains the radical horrors he has witnessed, but the layered nature of these horrors—their occupation of the moral and psychological realms as well as that of the physically observable—places them beyond the reach of language, which is, as Marlow himself indicates, fundamentally superficial. Marlow asserts that, when his boat was being “shot” at with “arrows,” he was surrounded by a “white fog” that put him in a “trance,” after which the helmsman was “shot” and gave an “extraordinary, profound” look before dying; at a different point, Marlow defeatedly tells his audience that he feels like he is trying to “tell… a dream… [of] being captured by the incredible” (48, 56, 32). Marlow’s use of the words “dream” and “incredible” evoke the image of experiences that lie beneath—that lie beyond—the mundane realm of exterior physical activity and perception. Therefore, Marlow’s suggestion that “tell[ing]” and language are incapable of capturing such inner “dream[s]” and “incredible” experiences suggests that he recognizes that words are intrinsically superficial—they are perhaps capable of recording “exterior” humans actions but not of documenting the inner moral and psychological experiences that dwell beneath them. Yet, paradoxically, the very horrific experiences Marlow is trying to document in words affect him primarily on a moral and psychological level—as opposed to the level of mundane surface-level physical perception. For example, in the scene where Marlow describes being shot at, his retrospective use of the words “trance” and “white fog” suggests that he had entered a mode of physical perception that was not really perception at all—that he was perceiving this event primarily through the lens of his own inner psychology and inner moral state. Yet when Marlow tries to describe his response to the helmsman’s death on a psychological level, all he can do is to list hollow, meaningless adjectives—“extraordinary,” “profound”—that ultimately skirt around, and reveal nothing about, what he was undergoing or feeling. Marlow's words are unable, it seems, to cut to the heart of the moral and psychological horrors he has experienced in the \"heart of darkness.” \n",
      "\n",
      "Marlow’s narration implies that the failure of his explanatory discourse throws him into a state of moral paralysis: Without any framework to help him assess the horrors he has seen, Marlow does little more than passively relay impressions from his own experiences—unable to decode or assess them for himself—in the vain hope that his audience (which includes the reader) might be able to penetrate those impressions for him. For example, Marlow describes the scene with the heads on the pikes largely in terms of an avalanche of sensory impressions, from the “shrunken dry lips” to the “round knobs” to the “narrow white line of the teeth”; at another point in his story, Marlow asks his crew-mates (and the reader), “Do you see the story? Do you see anything at all?” before pointing out that they, like all human beings, spend their entire lives dwelling on the “surface” of existence without considering the moral and psychological “realit[ies]” beneath (71-72, 32-33, 42). In the scene with the heads, Marlow’s exhaustively lists out his impressions but dedicates little time to analyzing them, suggesting that—lacking an explanatory framework to help him assess such impressions—he is unable to decode them himself. Therefore, one could interpret the questions Marlow asks of his audience—“Do you see the story? Do you see anything at all?”—as representing not Marlow’s impatience with incompetent listeners, but rather a plea for help: He is asking these questions, one could argue, because he cannot “see anything at all” himself—he has no explanatory discourse to light his path—and simply hopes that someone else might be able to help him “see,” to pinpoint the deeper moral implications of his experiences for him. But this is a futile hope. As Marlow himself recognizes, all people (including himself)—trapped in a system of language designed to document surface-level physical events—merely occupy the “surface” of reality without ever probing what lies beneath. If it is indeed language itself that cannot penetrate the moral and psychological realms—and, in particular, moral and psychological horrors—then perhaps there is no one who can create the discourse Marlow so badly needs. \n",

      "In Heart of Darkness, Joseph Conrad implies that the nature and structure of human language itself are well-suited to the rhetoric of colonialism. Human language, in Conrad’s conception, is a superficial mode of communication—it forecloses the possibility of expressing complex, multilayered ideas, and it therefore lends itself to discourses that simplify and that are simplistic. And as Conrad suggests, the discourses of imperialists—chauvinistic words that delineate a forceful, arbitrary binary between “savage” and “civilized”—certainly fit that definition. \n",

      "           Since March of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted every household in America in some capacity, but what most fail to consider is the other plague that is simultaneously disrupting millions of American households: food insecurity. As of 2009, more than 50 million people in the United States lived in a household classified as food insecure. Today, food insecurity is one of the most destructive nutrition-related public health issues in the U.S.[i] The United States of America is a country that had a 1.4-billion-pound dairy surplus in 2017 (and proceeded to dump millions of pounds of milk onto fields as an effect), and a country that continues to discard billions of pounds of food each year[ii], so how is it that millions of Americans are still going hungry in a country that has an overabundance of food? To understand modern food insecurity, one must first understand what it is and where it stemmed from. In simple terms, food insecurity is hunger; it is the lack of access to nutritious and affordable food. Food insecurity in America can be traced back for centuries; Americans have been food-insecure since the birth of the nation in the 18th century. Throughout the Gilded Age, poor working conditions, the lack of government regulation, and low salaries caused many workers to be food insecure as they did not have the means to provide meals for themselves and their families. During the Financial Panic of 1893 and the Great Depression in the late 1920s, food insecurity rates rose once again due to the high reported rates of poverty and unemployment. Modern food insecurity can be traced to Depression farms in the 1930s and New Deal policies. Redlining in American cities and communities resulted in the emergence of the grocery gap: a phenomenon existing in impoverished communities where it is easier to buy high-calorie, processed foods than fresh fruits and vegetables[iii]. Over time, these disparities only grew, and due to COVID-19, they continue to rise once again. Today, neighboring communities face completely different obstacles; one may be a food oasis and the other, a food apartheid (\"apartheid\" refers to the idea that food insecurity is primarily a result of failed policy and is not naturally occurring). Food security is a fundamental right that every American and every human deserves. No human should live in fear that they do not have the means to provide adequate meals for their family. No human should have to sacrifice their own meals to provide for their children. No human should be denied their fundamental rights.\n",
      "           The existing disparities between food insecurity rates and access to food in different communities are massive, and it is only growing larger. Imagine a city housing two communities, only miles apart, which face entirely different living circumstances. One community is the home to many migrant farmer families living food insecure. Some families can only afford to eat one meal a day, and many have developed diabetes, high blood pressure, and asthma as a result. Most do not have access to health insurance, and all medical expenses must be paid out of pocket. A few miles away from here, another community has access to an abundance of farmer's markets and grocery stores. Families living here have more than enough food to eat, and there is no lack of fresh fruits and vegetables.[iv] This is the disparity of food insecurity between communities in Santa Barbara, California, and many other American cities and towns. This disparity exists as a result of the relationship between food insecurity and income. The considerable price difference between unhealthy and healthy food and high calorie processed foods and fresh fruits and vegetables is unaffordable for many. Americans must sacrifice their health either by eating very few nutritious meals on an irregular basis or unhealthy, high caloric meals. It is also important to note the disparities between food insecure people in terms of race. More than 21% of all black people were food insecure or lived on the edge of hunger in 1999, and 20.8% of Hispanics, in contrast with only 7% of non-Hispanic white people, were reported to be food insecure.[v] Low-income and non-white neighborhoods have more fast-food restaurants than their counterparts. As a consequence of this grocery gap, low-income minority groups tend to consume fewer fruits and vegetables and have higher rates of obesity than their counterparts. These disparities between different groups of people concerning food insecurity can cause problems of their own. Food is essential in understanding the construction of personal and social identities, perpetuating racial stereotypes. Throughout history, black figures on food such as Aunt Jemima have become corporate trademarks, portrayed as an offensive and subservient figure. These stereotypes of the black community have been harmful, and in some cases, have contributed to the disparities around today among black and white community's food security rates[vi]. To combat these disparities, national and local policies have since been created to address food insecurity and target geographic and economic access to food. Through federal national benefits (such as S.N.A.P.) and tax incentives (such as the Healthy Food Financing Initiative), food has become more available to these target communities[vii]. However, with food insecurity rates on the rise as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, these federal programs cannot address all aspects of food insecurity or reach all that are food insecure. Food environment, the availability of food stores in a community, also affects the diet of low-income Americans, and few legislations and programs combat unjust food environments. In urban and rural areas, where food insecurity rates tend to be highest, smaller food stores, convenience stores, and fast-food restaurants are in excess, while supermarkets and farmers markets dominate suburban communities[viii]. The disparities between food insecure and food-secure communities are significant, and they present pressing issues. They complicate the meaning of citizenship, as these disparities between communities complicate the American ideal of equality. When some Americans live in extravagance while others live insufficiently, the idea of equality in terms of American citizenship becomes convoluted.\n",
      "           The existence of the hunger-obesity paradox complicates how American policies address hunger. In 2010, the American community with the highest reported food insecurity rates, the South Bronx district of New York City, also had the city's highest obesity rates[ix]. This is the hunger-obesity paradox: the idea that both hunger and obesity coexist in many Americans. Due to industrialization and urbanization in the 19th and 20th centuries, many Americans migrated from rural America to American suburbs and cities. As Americans mass-migrated, their knowledge of growing and preparing fresh, healthy foods diminished. During the post-World War II era, America began to produce more highly processed foods due to its newfound popularity. Canned, processed, shelf-stable, and microwavable meals would become common in American households following the 1950s[x]. As the types of foods available for preparation changed, so did the average American diet. For many low-income families, highly processed foods became the only option for supplying enough food for themselves. Under these difficult circumstances is where the hunger-obesity paradox exists. In the South Bronx district of New York City, the Health Bucks program encourages people to spend their S.N.A.P. food benefits at farmer's markets where every $5 spent results in an additional $2 benefit[xi]. Although programs like this can help combat food insecurity, they are not sufficient enough. It is unreasonable to assume that someone living in poverty would have access to transportation or the time to get to a farmer's market, as they are most commonly located in areas that are inaccessible to those living in food environments similar to the South Bronx. Like the Health Bucks program, food justice legislation, which fails to address food availability in low-income neighborhoods, is ineffective. It is not until America changes their perception of hunger that effective policies can be enacted. Not only should citizens have the right to be free from hunger, but the right to adequate access to nutritional, affordable foods. Legislation must combine efforts to increase accessibility and affordability to truly be effective. \n",
      "           The severe consequences of food insecurity complicate American ideas of equality through divisions in the existing health community. Pregnant women who are food insecure are at higher risk of congenital disabilities. Food insecure households are at higher risks of lower nutrition intakes, anemia, mental health issues, being hospitalized, and poorer general health. Due to the high presence of the hunger-obesity paradox, food-insecure Americans are more likely to have conditions such as Type 2 Diabetes and high blood pressure[xii]. A 2009 C.D.C. study estimated that annual obesity-care expenses in 2008 were at $147 billion, as much as 9 percent of all medical costs, and nearly doubled the 1998 estimate[xiii]. Hunger has always increased the likelihood to suffer from medical conditions, which causes food insecurity to impact other aspects of a person's life, such as their ability to work. In an effort to fight hunger, food security and health security have been added to the list of national security issues, resulting in more awareness and promoting the implications of new programs to supply healthy food and healthcare to those who do not have access to it[xiv]. Despite these efforts, it is essential to note that some food and health campaigns and foodservice providers are profitable businesses in disguise. Many American food banks marketed as humanitarian non-profits are linked to big for-profit businesses because of their existing partnerships between private food aid and large corporations. These sorts of schemes, sometimes unintentionally, promote food security as a biopolitical project rather than a national health crisis with severe consequences[xv]. The effects of food insecurity are real and pressing; until all food-insecure citizens have access to the care they need to combat existing health conditions, this crisis cannot be overcome. Health care is a crucial aspect of fighting existing food insecurity. \n",
      "           Access to an adequate standard of living is a fundamental human right. When living food insecure, one does not have access to this right. When a citizen does not have enough to eat, they are at a much greater risk to experience health issues, which can lead to an inability to work, resulting in decreased income. Food insecurity is cyclical in nature, and those who are living food insecure are not given the right resources to break out of this cycle for themselves and their children. America is a nation that prides itself on being the land of the free, a country where everyone is equal. The reality that the existing disparities between communities allows one to continually turn a blind eye to the other is truly paradoxical. There is a lack of accessible and affordable food in America: this must be acknowledged before it can be resolved. This is because of the disparities between American communities that jeopardize the American values of equality. Americans must begin to acknowledge the existing disparities between communities, change their perceptions on hunger, recognize the risks and severity of food insecurity, and acknowledge that food security is a right that every American should have access to. Only then can America begin to develop effective legislation that tackles all aspects of food insecurity to alleviate and remediate the problem.\n",

      "In 2009 following the release of Disney’s Princess and the Frog, there was a national salmonella outbreak because children began kissing frogs. We have to give them some credit—it doesn’t hold a candle to consuming tide pods—but still, we can’t help but marvel at their impressionability. The funny thing is, however, it’s not just children who are so easily changed by what they see in media: According to National Geographic, the movie Jaws is almost single-handedly responsible for Americans’ fear of sharks. NPR notes that the release of The Hunger Games caused national participation in archery to almost double. Study after study indicates that what you see on a screen can shape how you view the government, your career choices, your relationships, and your sense of identity. Film and TV have a profound impact on how you see the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because of the effect media has on us, it is crucial that we remember that the concepts behind films and movies aren’t generated in a vacuum; they’re stories, so they depend on the perspective of the storyteller. While actors do the delivering, the people who actually shape the story are the ones sitting in the director’s chair or in the writers’ room. We find that even as the screen gains color and variation, the people behind the scenes often remain startlingly undiverse. Our storytellers are disproportionately white and male; while some of my favorite films are by brilliant writers who are white men, it’s important to note that scripting is storytelling, and storytelling benefits from diversity in perspective. Minority representation in directors, producers, and editors along with diverse writers rooms can provide this in film and TV, respectively, but that level of representation remains rare in the industry. Without diverse storytellers, we are often limited to a single perspective, and the consequence is one-dimensional representation of minorities that hurts both the actors and the audience as it prevents minority stories from circulating.\n",
      "\n",
      "A primary example of lacking representation is how members of certain races begin filling “token” roles in the story that often play into stereotypes. For example, there’s a tendency for TV shows to emasculate Asian men, like Raj from Big Bang Theory or Han from Two Broke Girls, both of whom demonstrate feminine tendencies for comedic effect. Similarly, comedic duo Key and Peele make light of how the role they always end up auditioning for is that of “The Black Best Friend,” a stock character that rounds out a group of white friends and whose character depth is limited to sassy one-liners and undying support for the main character. There’s also a painfully obvious tendency for action and horror movies to kill off the colored characters first, which The Walking Dead was particularly guilty of in its treatment of black male characters. The spotlight is almost always on white characters in mass media, while other races are relegated to the background, underdeveloped, or disposable.\n",
      "\n",
      "This imbalance isn’t necessarily about the quantity of representation—it’s not about ticking off a box and patting oneself on the back: “I stuck a black guy in. Yay diversity!” It’s about quality, giving minority characters the complex storylines they deserve. We see this most clearly with women in Hollywood, who aren’t missing quantitative representation, but whose portrayals often lack quality; barring those made for all-female audiences, movies seldom feature female protagonists. Women are also highly sexualized in film, with the APA cautioning that 40% of the young women to appear in Hollywood's top films over the last decade were “scantily clad or naked”. How does this impact how society sees women? How young girls are encouraged to see ourselves? Issa Rae’s thin smile as she announced an all-male list of 2020 Oscar nominees for best director speaks volumes; female directors lack distribution, and thus the media that reaches the most people overwhelmingly features female characters that act as love interests and serve as the protagonist’s “prize”. Just how many times have we seen a storyline where a male hero undergoes some trial—anywhere from saving the world to a bit of character development—, comes out victorious, and is expected to “get the girl” by default? Female characters’ plotlines revolve around those of male characters all too often.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s not right that talented actors are being limited, that minority viewers can’t see themselves, and our society doesn’t have the benefit of seeing different people’s stories. That’s why movies like Wonder Woman, Black Panther, and Crazy Rich Asians are lauded as the triumphs they are—they’re making waves in putting fully realized minority characters onto our screens by putting minorities in the director’s chair. Several newer TV shows also present a diverse, complex cast; Black Mirror, for example, shows us that anyone, regardless of race, gender, or sexual orientation, can be brutally tortured by futuristic technology. The Good Place, Jane the Virgin, and many other series popular with Gen Z are similarly good at handling diversity, and accordingly, all of these shows boast diverse writers' rooms and producers. When minorities begin to take on roles behind the scenes, we see those stories represented on the screen. \n",
      "\n",
      "I can say firsthand that this element can mean everything to viewers; growing up, I wanted to see a protagonist I could connect to, who might be telling my story; as a colored girl, I’d resigned myself to the fact that I’d seldom be able to identify with a main protagonist. The characters who formed their words the way I did or whose skin matched my own were often exaggerated caricatures, leaving me with a tight-lipped smile and a queasy feeling in the pit of my stomach each time their oddities set off the laugh track. Now, as I watch my younger sister gleefully don her Elena of Avalor Halloween costume—“She looks just like me!”—I can’t help my giddy astonishment at the growing changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "We can continue to move in this direction by supporting minority filmmakers through paying to see their work instead of illegally downloading it, thereby allowing them to gain funding and distribution. In addition to practicing conscious consumerism, we need to open ourselves up to new stories because the stories we are exposed to are the lenses through which we see the world. Stories, whether expressed in conversation or written and visual mediums, are our means of connecting with people of different identities we couldn’t otherwise understand, and anything that precious must be shared.\n",

      "           The South Korean Refugee Dilemma: They or One of Us\n",
      " \n",
      "           A few hundred miles away from the bustling capital of South Korea, one finds a small island replete with lush mountains, fields of cosmos flowers, and vibrant bodies of water. Here, Korean city dwellers seek an escape from their demanding lives, and tourists from all corners of Asia are drawn to the natural landscape. While a flourishing tourism industry gives Jeju Island an appreciable stake in the Korean economy, it has otherwise been considered detached from the mainland’s politics. Throughout the turmoil of a presidential impeachment and widespread protests against government corruption, the small population of Jeju Island did not exert much political sway.\n",
      "           In early 2018, however, the name of the island decorated headlines for something much different from its natural wonders. Some 500 asylum seekers from Yemen, Syria, and Egypt poured into Jeju Island, constituting an influx that dwarfed the slow trickle of refugees typically seen in South Korea. These refugees -- the majority of them Yemeni -- were fleeing a catastrophic civil war that has claimed more than 60,000 lives to date. Many of them had initially sought refuge in Malaysia, but upon learning that Malaysia was not a signatory to the United Nations Refugee Convention, took a budget-airline flight to South Korea in search of better living conditions (Kwon). This was made possible by a 30-day visa-free policy devised by the Korean government to attract foreign tourists to Jeju Island. For these refugees, the end of the visa-free period marked South Korea’s transition from a sanctuary to a hostile foreign land.\n",
      "           A bewildered public looked to European refugee crises to predict the future of their country -- this, obviously, was not a source of optimism. In the coming weeks, a resounding outcry against the Middle Eastern refugees was heard in urban areas of the peninsula. Thousands of protesters took to the streets demanding that the refugees be deported immediately; 700,000 more signed a petition imploring the president to put the deportation into effect[1]. It quickly became the most popular petition on the online platform offered by the President’s Office, surpassing pleas to decriminalize early-stage abortion or to take measures against child pornography. In response, the government proposed an action plan. Parts of it, such as the hiring of translators at the Jeju Immigration Office, were inoffensive; other parts simply gave into the public’s apprehension, adding twelve Middle Eastern and African nations to a list of nations excluded from the visa exemption policy.\n",
      "           For a country that was devastated by civil war and poverty not too many decades ago, why was it unimaginable that others would be seeking respite from the same? Clearly, factors other than a simple lack of empathy were at play. Political context complicates this comparison; South Korea has only recently begun to embrace multiculturalism as an alternative to the strong, homogeneous national identity that had been set in stone following 35 years of colonial rule. Though Koreans were initially reluctant to welcome any foreigners, the country’s diplomatic ties with the U.S. naturally exposed them to Western cultures that were viewed as admirable rather than alien.\n",
      "           Despite the steady integration of Western and East Asian immigrants into Korean society, South Korea has turned a cold shoulder to refugees ever since it settled into economic stability. In 1992, the country became a signatory to the UN Refugee Convention, pledging to play their part in protecting refugees whose home countries pose threats to their life or freedom. In 2012, Korea even adopted an official refugee law, but it seems that their consequent humanitarian duties have been all but abandoned. For the past two decades, the Korean government accepted only 42,000 asylum seeking applications; of those, 849 people (about two percent) were granted refugee status (Ock). Those permitted to stay have formed enclaves that insulate them from full cultural or linguistic integration. Their job prospects are severely limited -- refugees attest to working for weeks without being paid, working 18-20 hours a day, and even being physically assaulted by employers (Ghani). While the recent Yemeni refugee crisis was a rude awakening to Korea's mishandling of its international obligations, it is merely a symptom of a decades-long problem, waiting to surface.\n",
      "           On face, it is unclear what motivates such intense xenophobia in a highly educated, well-to-do country that could comfortably accommodate a few hundred refugees. A study by Hankook Ilbo (a major Korean news outlet) investigated the weight of variables such as age, gender, and monthly income on Koreans’ attitude toward Yemeni refugees (Lee and Park). The trends gathered in this survey did not paint a clear picture. Respondents in their 40s were less opposed to refugee acceptance than those in their 20s and 30s, despite younger people being the driving force behind Korea’s shift to liberalism. Women objected more strongly than men, and monthly income had no discernible effect on people’s opinions. Put together, these results indicate that no one personal attribute explains away the nationwide uproar, so plainly visible on the streets.\n",
      "           We then turn, not to dissecting each individual’s position on refugee issues, but to examining the basis of Korean society’s general attitude toward refugees. Owing to its history of frequent but inconclusive foreign invasions, Korea is an incredibly ethnically homogeneous nation. 97.7% of the population is ethnically Korean, and other ethnicities barely comprise 1% of the population. A robust body of scholarship explains that the genealogy of Korean nationalism began at the end of the 19th century, when Japanese and Western powers descended on the peninsula (Shin). Politicians of the severely weakened Joseon Dynasty clung on to nationalism as a form of resistance. This brand of nationalism particularly focused on ethnic uniformity by design, directly contesting imperial Japan’s narrative that Japanese and Korean people shared a common ancestry. The political sentiment that emerged was one that reified the nation and its native-born people, rather than its shared civic ideals.\n",
      "           While an abstract ideology dating back to the 19th century may seem removed from the 2018 refugee crisis, the power that ethnic nationalism still wields over Korean society cannot be underestimated. A principle that is, in most countries, associated with right wing populism, instead spans both ends of the political spectrum -- Korean-ness is a prerequisite for participation in society (Lee). It should not come as a surprise, then, that one of the most common slogans seen at protests was “the people of Korea come first.” Refugees, universally portrayed as vulnerable and at a loss for national identity, were seen as taking away from the resources, land, and pride that rightfully belonged to Koreans. Similar responses have been seen in other nations; in Norway, for example, announcements of refugee acceptance (in numbers that have never exceeded 10,000) have also been couched in nationalistic language. Sylvi Listhaug, the Norwegian immigration minister, emphasised that Norway is faced with “a big challenge now to integrate those with permission to stay in Norway to make sure they respect Norwegian values” (Nelson). Her words illuminate a clear parallel to South Korea: both developed nations with an uncompromising sense of national pride, reluctant to open their doors to strangers needing refuge.\n",
      "           Even outside the scope of refugee issues, the rejection and disenfranchisement of minorities is not a uniquely Korean phenomenon. Analogous practices of cultural and legal gatekeeping can be found throughout history. A particularly troubling example lies in the progression of racism in the United States, a practice dating back to slavery in the 17th century and persisting through its cultural remnants in the modern day. In the decades following the Civil War, America saw Jim Crow laws upholding segregation and violence intended to suppress Black Americans’ political freedom. Public spaces and schools were racially segregated, Black people had no legal recourse if found guilty of crimes they did not commit, and the fear of lynching was both real and omnipresent as the Ku Klux Klan underwent a resurgence. Only in 1964 -- a full century after the 13th Amendment legally abolished slavery -- was the Civil Rights Act passed, ending the codification of Jim Crow laws. At this point, however, institutionalized racism was already deeply ingrained in both the South and the North. In 2020, it still prevails in the country’s memory.\n",
      "           In particular, one consequence of the Jim Crow era stands out as comparable with the shunning of refugees in South Korea: the use of law enforcement as a systematic means for disenfranchisement. Prior to the abolition of slavery, the freedom of the Black population was taken away by the word of the law. Though the passage of new bills and civic activism apparently put an end to this pillage, overt inequality simply became subtle enough to seep through the Constitution’s loopholes. The Atlantic documentary, “Angola for Life: Rehabilitation and Reform Inside the Louisiana State Penitentiary,” draws attention to a caveat in the 13th Amendment: “Neither slavery nor indentured servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States” (Benns). This convenient exception has since been exploited endlessly by those in power, criminalizing Black people for all manner of petty misconduct and using their incarceration as justification for slavery masquerading as “prison labor.” This, according to legal scholar Michelle Alexander, effectively maintains a modern-day caste system in America (21).\n",
      "           While the Korean refugee crisis is not as historically entrenched as the American racial divide, the iron-fisted treatment of refugees is headed in a dangerously similar direction. Koreans have seemingly bought into the “broken windows” theory, which claims that criminals perceive signs of minor disorder (e.g., broken windows) as indicative of a powerless government (Kelling and Wilson). In the U.S., police departments enthusiastically caught onto the idea and used it to justify “zero tolerance” policing, unsurprisingly targeting a disproportionate number of minorities. Much like broken windows, the crimes that came under attack were benign, victimless infractions; while it is true they posed some inconvenience, their criminality was mostly a figment of the public’s imagination. Using this principle, the Korean media, government, and public have jointly invented a divide between “real refugees” and “fake refugees” (Choe). Echoing white America’s criminalization of Black citizens, both out of real (albeit unfounded) racial anxiety and a desire to oppress, Koreans were quick to accuse Muslim refugees of high-profile crimes they did not commit. Some of these accusations were simply variations of prevalent Islamophobic beliefs that conflate refugees with Islamic terrorists. Others alleged that Yemeni refugees were sexually assaulting female tourists in Jeju Island. One protester summed it all up when he told the Arab News, “Refugees, including Yemenis are not only a threat to our people but also that to our future generation. Some of them are not even real refugees. Most of them are able-bodied men so they’re fake” (Sung). With a level of efficiency unprecedented in gridlocked politics, Korean Congress passed a set of laws, uncannily similar to zero tolerance laws written by past U.S. governments. The revised ‘Refugee Act’ would carry out strict background checks, crack down on visa overstays, and terminate asylum applications for anyone who had temporarily returned to their home country. Informally, local governments advised new refugees to “stay indoors as much as possible” (Bloomberg).\n",
      "           Needless to say, neither the U.S. criminal justice system nor the Korean refugee crisis is close to a just resolution. However, in similar problems we may find similar solutions -- many of the reforms that U.S. racial justice activists have proposed are applicable in South Korea as well. Organizers behind campaigns against racism in policing have long advocated for the decriminalization of drug possession, a victimless crime for which Black people have been disproportionately convicted (Cooper and Thompson). Plenty of evidence favors this policy change; a statewide study in Oregon projected that decriminalizing the possession of controlled substances would reduce the number of convicted Black and Native residents by approximately 94% (Oregon Secretary of State). Across the U.S., drug-related offenses are the most common cause for arrest. Among those arrested, defendants who cannot afford legal representation or bail payment, i.e. largely poor racial minorities, are carried away to the prison industrial complex. Thus, increasing legal leniency for drug possession has frequently decorated the agendas of organizations such as the ACLU.\n",
      "           Across the Pacific Ocean, refugees also struggle against the grain of the Korean legal system. The Justice Minister himself cautioned that refugees who “contravene the social order” would be deported, at the same time that he announced strict penalties for “refugee brokers” who facilitated refugees’ migration (Park). As a result, 56 out of the 500 Yemeni refugees were ordered to leave Korea, 400 were granted tenuous “humanitarian stay” permits that could be revoked upon any trivial infraction, and only two were granted refugee status (Global Detention Project). To allow refugees any chance of successful integration, the Korean government must lift the unforgiving legal standards that leave their right to stay constantly hanging in the balance. The government ought to take the advice of experienced activists in the U.S. and stop treating criminalization of the most oppressed as an antidote to social disorder. Practically, this would look like lifting travel restrictions that limit refugees’ right to move outside their port of arrival; not penalizing asylum seekers who had to rely on brokers to get to the country; discontinuing the xenophobically charged profiling of refugees who have no reason to be suspected of criminal activity.\n",
      "           Furthermore, South Korea would come closer to fulfilling their humanitarian obligation by establishing programs that allocate financial, social, and legal aid to refugees -- not unlike existing welfare programs abroad and at home. In the case of the U.S., the National Immigration Forum reports that resettlement agencies assist refugees with accessing essential services such as school enrollment and applying for social security. Some financial assistance is offered as well; the State Department’s Reception and Placement (R&P) program funds resettlement agencies to finance refugees’ first 30-90 days in the U.S. Similarly in Canada, asylum seekers are entitled to healthcare, as well as housing assistance and social welfare in many cases (Cheatham). While some initial political backlash is to be expected -- those who were anti-refugees will not become pro-refugee-welfare overnight -- such reforms may ultimately lead to a change in public attitude. Whereas the continuous deportation of refugees will simply confirm Koreans’ belief that they are criminals who do not belong in the country, increased legal forgiveness and assistance will give refugees a chance to participate in society without fear of overstepping the law. Not only does this promise to dismiss the perception of criminal behavior, it will also allow refugees to become more self-sufficient, as former skilled workers will occupy higher-paying jobs than are available in the fishing and agricultural industries. In a country that places high value on individual merit and frowns upon non-nationals who apparently take without giving, refugees need room to demonstrate their virtues, both for their welfare and for Korea’s future role in the global refugee crisis.\n",
      "           Between 2015 and 2017, the number of people applying for refugee status in South Korea nearly doubled. The 2018 refugee crisis was not an isolated incident, but rather a harbinger for continually increasing refugee numbers. South Korea has thus far gotten away with positioning itself away from the crises in Europe and Africa, but can shirk its responsibility only for so long. The Korean public is not entirely to blame; the ethnic homogeneity of the country and historical need for nationalism have rendered Koreans predisposed to xenophobic beliefs. But it is possible to be both patriotic and open-minded. Rather than giving into citizens’ fear-driven demands, the government must exempt refugees from punishment for petty crimes and assist their path to economic independence. Unless they reverse the course of refugee mistreatment, far down this road is a social hierarchy reminiscent of America’s prison industrial complex and systemic discrimination. The Korean government sits on the chance to join its international peers by treating refugees with kindness; they must do so before intolerance calcifies in the country’s politics.\n",

      "Few modern superhero stories have ever been as reflective, deconstructive, and deeply knowledgeable of the superhero genre as Alan Moore’s and Dave Gibbons’s masterwork, Watchmen. A DC-serialized graphic novel first released in 1986, Watchmen appealed heavily to the zeitgeist of an America under conservative leadership during the tail-end years of the Cold War and redefined the superhero genre in all its forms and permutations for decades to come. Fully describing the incredible impact of Watchmen is a gargantuan task, and attempting to further elaborate on what made it so vastly acclaimed is just as difficult. However, a good introductory starting point to Watchmen’s near-universal resonance is its alternate-universe iteration of American history, which never loses track of its realism-oriented framework, and always remains relevant to the American society it aims to reflect.\n",
      " \n",
      "Watchmen depicts an alternate reality where the split between its universe and ours occurs in 1938. The emergence of the very first “superhero”, Hooded Justice, leads to the concept of masked vigilantes growing significantly popular and widespread. As the amount of superheroes starts growing in number and in influence, several different events in United States history are drastically altered in the process. For instance, a patriot-themed, far-right superhero dubbed the Comedian notoriously prevents the Watergate scandal from reaching the public, thus allowing Richard Nixon’s presidency to continue for five terms. Dr. Manhattan, a superhero who possesses a litany of god-like superhuman capabilities, is appropriated and used by the United States government in the Vietnam War, leading to the US's disturbingly quick victory and raising tensions with the Soviet Union. Already, we see that Watchmen establishes a theoretical moral framework for its superheroes. Many of the actions they take range from ethically ambiguous to outright criminal, evoking a \"persistent uncertainty as to whether [these] superheroes should pursue their self-imposed obligation for the pursuit of [a]... subjectively defined 'justice'\" (Giddens).\n",
      " \n",
      "In 1977, after a significant amount of uproar from law enforcement officials emerges, claiming that the existence of superheroes now threatens their careers, the Keene Act is signed, banning all heroes but the Comedian and Dr. Manhattan from ever working publicly again; the final nail in the coffin for a decades-long legacy of widely mocked vigilantism. The graphic novel opens in 1986, where the Comedian has been killed and viciously thrown out the window of his apartment by an unseen assailant. In the aftermath, Rorschach, a rogue, terribly unstable, and similarly far-right vigilante who refused to abide by the Keene Act, decides to investigate his murder. With the help of several different ex-heroes — the tech-centric Nite Owl, former sex symbol Silk Spectre, ex-superhero narcissist billionaire Ozymandias, and Dr. Manhattan himself — the group ultimately ends up uncovering a Cold War-embroiled conspiracy that threatens not only the remaining ex-superheroes, but also millions of innocent civilian lives.\n",
      " \n",
      "Having covered the nuances of Watchmen’s alternate reality and its relatively grounded approach to the idea of superheroes in general, it becomes worth noting that there are an exhaustive plethora of things worth covering about the graphic novel's impeccable artistry. For one, it captivatingly uses cinematic devices, motifs, and visuals that only truly work within the graphic novel medium, using numerous references to art and music that give an extra layer of meaning to already excellent scenes. Likewise, the unparalleled development and depth given to each of these heroes’ pasts, beliefs, and ever-constant fallibility is also a key benefit, as well as the inclusion of supplementary excerpts, articles, and news reports at the end of each chapter that offer further insight into Watchmen’s Cold War America. Most importantly, however, as Boston University's Jeffrey Wu claims, “The true sense of morality in Watchmen lies in its lack of a ‘true hero,’ of a ‘right and wrong,’ of a ‘correct’ answer. The world the Watchmen inhabit is dark, gloomy, and above all, vicious… In a single word, Watchmen is gothic\" (2). At its very core, Watchmen is a comic book about comic books, and its incredible mastery over the graphic novel medium and all of its foundational intricacies is an achievement not many modern works of art have exhibited or ever will exhibit.\n",
      " \n",
      "However, despite this encyclopedia’s worth of information about Watchmen’s universe, story structure, and visual detail, a disturbingly low number of adaptations and continuations to Watchmen have managed to successfully grasp any of it, to a degree where even writer Alan Moore has publicly made known his own disillusionment with adapting his own work (Epstein). For instance, Zack Snyder’s 2009 film adaptation of Watchmen not only fails to understand what narrative devices the graphic novel utilizes to portray realistic modern superheroes as a rather pathetic concept, but also alters a significant portion of the graphic novel’s ending to a point where its original thematic resonance fails to make any coherent sense. Doomsday Clock, another serialized comic book sequel to Watchmen that ran from 2017 to 2019, places Watchmen's characters alongside the DC superheroes they deconstructed, construing an optimistic meaning out of Watchmen’s bleak story with a dysfunctional foundation.\n",
      " \n",
      "Perhaps the strongest appeal to Watchmen that its adaptations and sequels have failed to grasp, however, is its incredible relevance to the Cold War era it was released in — its usage and alteration of actual historical events from the 1940s to the 1980s in order to reflect Cold War fears over nuclear holocaust was one of the main factors that made it such an excellent piece of work for its time. Perhaps its most important motif is the clock nearing midnight — an image popularized by the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists — as a visual device conveying the world's slow march towards utter catastrophe, always seen on the cusp of some disaster. In some ways, these themes still resonate today, as continued tensions over the existence of nuclear weapons ensure that these sorts of Cold War fears, although somewhat diluted, remain a constant afterthought in our collective subconscious. As such, Watchmen is a deliberate product of its era and has universally resonated with an audience of stalwart loyalty because of it — the core tenet that adaptational works such as Snyder’s Watchmen and Doomsday Clock have never really found a relevant place for. It is, in essence, a \"historiographic metafiction, [one that] challenges institutions in the readers' ontology and warns... about the dangers of taking a single perception of the world as the only possible reality\" (Ganteau 186).\n",
      " \n",
      "With this general foundation in mind of what exactly makes Watchmen so appealing and seemingly impenetrable for adaptation, it now becomes worth addressing the context behind Damon Lindelof’s Watchmen HBO miniseries, a Watchmen continuation which premiered on October 20, 2019 to critical acclaim and numerous accolades. Its most impressive achievement and main point of acclaim was finally being the Watchmen sequel to fully comprehend what made the graphic novel tick.\n",
      " \n",
      "~~~~~~~~~\n",
      " \n",
      "On May 25, 2020, a Black man named George Floyd was murdered by the Minneapolis police in what would become not only the latest in a series of racially charged police killings, but also the impetus for the most energetic resurgence of the Black Lives Matter movement in recent memory. These drastic cultural developments have led to a somewhat widespread cultural reevaluation in America regarding the media we consume, how aware we as a country really are of systemic injustices, and to what extent media reflecting a racially charged American history can educate and inform us on its fundamental outcomes.\n",
      " \n",
      "Nowhere is this reevaluation perhaps more poignant, however, than the very opening scene of HBO’s Watchmen being frequently mentioned for bringing awareness to a long-suppressed, real-life incident in America’s racial history. The incident in question is the Tulsa Race Massacre of 1921, in which several groups of deputized white residents of Tulsa, with the support of the Ku Klux Klan, viciously slaughtered dozens to hundreds of Black residents and burned down an entire Black-owned district (Lindelof and Kassell).\n",
      " \n",
      "This is the backdrop for The Leftovers and Lost creator Damon Lindelof’s visionary modern interpretation of Watchmen — a story set to the idea of recontextualizing America’s history with racism through a modern remix and continuation of a timeless superhero story. Much like how the Cold War was an inextricable part of the graphic novel’s thematic argument, racism and its storied history are nigh-irreplaceable in the miniseries’ thematic thesis, and it strives for incredible lengths to offer what could well be the leading example of depicting racism in a mainstream superhero story.\n",
      " \n",
      "2019’s Watchmen is, through and through, a story about legacy, trauma, and history, and the graphic novel is no exception to being a primary contributor to the long-lasting ramifications of this legacy. Thirty-one years after the incredible devastation left behind by the graphic novel’s bleak ending and ninety-five years after the events of the Tulsa Race Massacre, a white supremacist militant group known as the Seventh Kavalry emerges, inspired by Rorschach’s disjointed record of his 1986 investigation and revolted by reparations for victims of racial injustice in a left-leaning presidential administration. After months of preparation, the Kavalry stages a vicious attack on all police officers of color in the Tulsa Police Department, killing dozens of officers and causing almost all of the remaining survivors of the attack to depart from the force in an event known as the White Night.\n",
      " \n",
      "As part of the three-year rebuilding process, however, new legislation mandates current police officers to don masks and shield their identities, which also permits the revitalized existence of “superheroes,” this time as costumed officers sanctioned under the law. The ensuing investigation and crackdown on the Seventh Kavalry — spearheaded by Angela “Sister Night” Abar, Wade “Looking Glass” Tillman, and police chief Judd Crawford— eventually leads down a spiraling rabbit hole of harsh betrayal, shocking revelations, and unspeakable bigotry. Old characters from the graphic novel are reintroduced, the origins of Watchmen’s superheroes in 1938 are truly given flesh, and American history is given a more significant role in the Watchmen canon than they have ever taken on before.\n",
      " \n",
      "One example of the appeals of 2019’s Watchmen is its incredible understanding of the source material when it comes down to how it reincorporates the original characters into this new story. A more notable character who almost perfectly fits this bill would be Laurie “Silk Spectre II” Juspeczyk, the daughter of the first-generation Silk Spectre, Sally Juspeczyk, a vigilante and sex symbol who had once been sexually assaulted by the Comedian early on in her career. As the story continues on, Laurie’s somewhat optimistic worldview is gradually eroded by her true origins and the devastation left behind by the graphic novel’s ending, even as she learns the importance of nostalgia and love in her rather turbulent life. As such, in 2019, a much older Laurie — fantastically portrayed by a deeply layered performance from Jean Smart — takes on a much more sardonic and cynical persona as she actively adopts the role of hunting down non-sanctioned “superheroes” for a sect of the FBI.\n",
      " \n",
      "However, her cynicism serves as a masquerade for her own pain, which stems from a deep sense of abandonment from the two men she loved most; Nite Owl and Dr. Manhattan. The former has been sent to prison, and the latter has departed the planet entirely, which crushes Laurie’s sense of self and ultimately causes her to act out of bitterness. Early on in the series, she joins the Tulsa Police Department’s task force against the Seventh Kavalry, and as the investigation progresses, she rediscovers important parts of her past, coming to the realization that her nostalgia for her relationships still remains. While her love for the two men in her life may be a satirization of oversexualized, paper-thinly characterized superheroines in the superhero genre, it eventually becomes a major part of how she heals from her trauma, putting on display the showrunners’ adept skill at managing to re-idealize grim deconstructions.\n",
      " \n",
      "Many of the newer characters introduced in the miniseries also manage to follow the graphic novel’s psychologically insightful framework for character development. The series’ primary protagonist, Angela Abar — portrayed excellently by Regina King — serves as a very well-established example of this reflective narrative philosophy in action. One of the leading detectives in the Tulsa Police Department, Angela dons the persona of “Sister Night”, a character inspired by the lead in a fictional blaxploitation film from her traumatic childhood. After being led to a harrowing discovery regarding the Tulsa PD’s leadership by Will Reeves — an enigmatic Black centenarian survivor of the Tulsa Massacre with a long and a shockingly influential past — Angela is forced to come to terms with her own trauma and legacy throughout the investigation. Such a journey leads her all the way back to the origin of superheroes in an America undergoing racial turmoil in 1938, tying the war with racism being fought in the present back to a key part of its historical roots, and powerfully connecting both these systemic conflicts to the very origin of Watchmen’s masked vigilantes. Other characters fighting the Seventh Kavalry such as Looking Glass and Will Reeves receive similarly investigative and psychologically insightful character profiles, often having entire episodes devoted to them in the same fashion as the graphic novel’s chapters. Such attention to structural detail ensures that the miniseries’ framework for creating characters directly parallels and expands on that of its predecessor.\n",
      " \n",
      "Adding onto all this, the Watchmen miniseries takes a distinctly significant number of cues from the graphic novel and almost perfectly reflects the minutiae of its impeccable artistry. It takes the graphic novel’s incredibly captivating usage of cinematic devices, motifs, and visuals and translates them straight to the medium of television, using references to the graphic novel, stage musicals such as Oklahoma!, and other forms of art that give an extra layer of meaning to already excellent scenes. It cultivates an incredible sense of development and depth given to both the new and existing heroes’ pasts, traumas, and fallibilities, while always maintaining a sense of deconstruction and homage. It includes supplementary materials in a website called Peteypedia, all of which give more insight into Watchmen’s racially divided America. Most importantly, however, it yet again deals heavily with moral ambivalence. Heroes are not what they seem, repressing their anger and shame behind masks, while villains are concealed behind the veneer of heroism and nobility.\n",
      " \n",
      "As such, Lindelof and the miniseries’ creators’ understanding of the graphic novel’s minutiae reveals not only their devotion to comprehending its artistry, but also their undeniably keen desire to create the superhero genre's own historiographic metafiction of the 2010s. We find ourselves in a modern era where dozens of Black men and women shot and killed by police cannot find justice; an era where fanatical bigotry is seeing a revival in existing neo-fascist groups reflected through the Seventh Kavalry; an era where systemic issues such as redlining, racial housing quotas, and circumvention of anti-discriminatory laws lead to disproportionate poverty for people of color; an era where the anger and suffering caused by racism have forced people onto the streets even in the midst of a global pandemic, and the list continues on. The Watchmen miniseries, much like its predecessor, reveals a striking awareness of this history, and even if it alters many of these events through the lens of science-fiction, it is not without purpose and never seems completely outlandish in doing so.\n",
      " \n",
      "Through recontextualizing racism through science fiction while retaining the necessary historical context, the Watchmen miniseries truly reaffirms the Atlas-esque social and political weight of its own title. It's an ornately detailed and deconstructive superhero story with an inextricable connection to the systemic concerns of the era it exists in, whether that be the existential dread of the Cold War and its numerous administrative failures, or the eternal conflict with racism and its vile permutations. Nothing ever ends, and Watchmen will forever be one of the greatest artistic representations of that constant eternity, no matter what we choose to make of it.\n",

      "What are the fundamental axioms of Blackness? How do they dictate the Black experience? Toni Morrison investigates these questions in her novel Jazz, where she follows the journeys of various characters who grapple with the nature of their personal and racial identities. In doing so, Morrison explores the fundamental nature of whiteness and Blackness, specifically through Golden Grey, arguing that the structures of whiteness and Blackness live in a coexistent, codependent, but unequal dichotomy—such unequal dichotomy is what allows white oppression to thrive. White racial subjugation is  a continuous theme strung throughout the text, eventually leading to metaphorical depictions of the bustling Black communities of Harlem, through which Morrison argues that Black existence must continually evolve in the face of oppressive white institutionalism. These ideas manifest themselves in the sensation of fluidity, or the feeling of a divergent identity caused by the oppressive structure of the dominant white race, which is intrinsically unique to the African American experience as the dehumanization of Blackness in society is what allows whiteness as a dominant power to exist. Although this need to be fluid supposedly eradicates the ability for one to possess a unified sense of self, Morrison offers that unification comes instead through acceptance. Ultimately, Morrison argues that stability is rooted in the acceptance of a fundamentally unstable, ever-changing form of Blackness—thus, hope and power can be found within contradiction.\n",
      "Through the journey of Golden Grey, Morrison argues that the structures of whiteness and Blackness are dependent on each other—the existence of Blackness allows for whiteness to exist not simply as a social construct but also as an ideal or dream for Black people—in this way, embodying Blackness was to embody a burden. Golden manifests the personification of societal whiteness because his identity as a white person is fabricated: although he is racially both Black and white, he identifies as and is only accepted through his whiteness. When Golden was born, True Belle and Vera Louise were ecstatic by his white appearance: “True Belle told him Vera Louise had smiled and said, ‘But he’s golden. Completely golden!’ So they named him that and didn’t take him to the Catholic Foundling Hospital, where white girls deposited their mortification” (148). True Belle’s reaction upon seeing Golden’s hair for the first time was a smile, indicating that Golden’s “complete goldenness” was a source of relief for both True Belle and Vera Louise. This suggests that if Golden had appeared Black, it would be a source of restlessness. Morrison uses the word “but” in the beginning of Vera Louise’s dialogue to signify the dismissal of Golden’s Blackness which can only be done because Golden appears to be white; this idea is then further highlighted by True Belle and Vera Louise’s decision to not go to the Catholic Foundling Hospital, a place where white girls are shamed for their mixed-heritage babies. Their refusal to go to the hospital shows that Vera Louise and True Belle didn't feel the need to be ashamed about Golden because Golden embodies whiteness. Their decision to name Golden after his golden hair demonstrates that his white characteristics are what define him. Morrison utilizes the idea that Golden was a “white baby” to argue that cultural whiteness and being genetically white are systematically different from each other—one doesn’t need to be completely white to embody whiteness, and vice versa. This characterization is further elaborated upon during Golden’s interaction with his father, who says: “‘Look. Be what you want—white or Black. Choose. But if you choose Black, you got to act Black, meaning draw your manhood up—quicklike, and don’t bring me no whiteboy sass” (173). Golden’s father preemptively stamps the “white” label on Golden by indicating that Golden could “choose to be Black” if he wanted to, moreover, if he tried. The father’s emphasis on Golden having to “act Black” and not to bring any “whiteboy sass” if he wanted to be Black shows that Golden must make a conscious effort to embody Blackness but not to embody whiteness because he is inherently defined by his white appearance. Golden’s father characterizes whiteness and Blackness as polarized structures unable to reconcile—because Golden’s father believed that Blackness is characterized by certain actions or thoughts, to embody whiteness was to lack those characteristics. In this way, Morrison argues that whiteness and Blackness are relative constructs: because white identity is dependent on not embodying Blackness and Blackness is dependent on not embodying whiteness, the existence of these structures rely on each other. This relationship, although contingent on dependency, is also unequal: the vitality of whiteness is founded on its ability to characterize the embodiment of Blackness as a burden. The fact that Golden is perceived as a white character throughout the novel is a tangible example of this: Golden’s embodiment of whiteness doesn’t come from his identity as a fully white person—he’s only half white—instead, his whiteness is founded on the fundamental belief that he’s not Black. As shown through his birth and his interaction with his father, Golden’s whiteness is contingent upon other people’s view of him as white— his white identity is not rooted in his own conscious decision, but rather a label that was placed on him by others beginning at birth, a part of his life when he had no control. Golden’s whiteness is not natural, it is a product of his surroundings: thus, whiteness is not only a social construct, but the ultimate manifestation of Black subjugation. \n",
      "Golden’s two-dimensional perceptions of whiteness and Blackness are what contribute to his lack of awareness, revealing that he uses societal constructs of Blackness to subjugate and confine Black people as a means to push his own simplistic narrative. Golden is conditioned to view society through a stark Black and white lens because that was all he was exposed to from birth. He subjugates other characters through his own understanding of what it means to be Black or white. Societal ideas of whiteness and Blackness invade his perception, blinding him from the true complexities of race and status. When Golden encounters Wild, a Black woman who is hurt after falling from a tree, he reacts in dismissal: “He wants nothing to do with what he has seen—in fact he is certain that what he is running from is not a real woman but a vision” (144). He describes Wild’s eyes as “large” and “terrible,” showing how he equates Blackness with disgust. Golden forces himself to be “certain that what he was running from is not a real woman but a vision,” highlighting how he wants his perceptions of Blackness to remain extraordinarily concrete. However, Golden faces a dilemma when he recognizes that his horse is Black too: “he can't help noticing that his horse is also black, naked and shiny wet, and his feelings about the horse are of security and affection. It occurs to him that there is something odd about that: the pride he takes in his horse, the nausea the woman provoked” (144). Golden’s positive feelings towards the horse stemmed from the fact that his horse drives him forward. He describes the horse as “black,” “naked,” and “shiny wet,” taking on an almost sexualized tone—the horse becomes like a deity, moreover, a being of obsessive admiration. Through these descriptions, orrison juxtaposes Golden’s “pride” for his horse and his “nausea” towards Wild. Golden finding both “security” and “disgust” in Blackness simultaneously contradicts his one-dimensional perception of what Blackness is. In order to relieve this contradiction, Golden forces himself to see Wild as merely a vision, allowing him to dismiss her humanity and also dismiss any belief that Blackness could be complex. His desire to do this is rooted inwards, by Golden’s perceptions of his own identity: Golden simplifies his ideas of Blackness because his simplification of Blackness is what gives him power. \n",
      "Whiteness and Blackness exist in a codependent, but unequal dichotomy; this means that whiteness thrives on its subjugation of Blackness, while Blackness remains confined in a white-imposed one-dimensionalism. This subjugation of Blackness creates a societally defined need for fluidity because it is the only way Blackness can exist beyond white-imposed barriers. While fluidity should give Blackness power, it also creates a lack of personal self identity amongst Black people. This idea is most present in Morrison’s characterization of Harlem, a predominantly Black city: \"Really, there is no contradiction— rather it’s a condition: the range of what an artful city can do… tar softens under the heel and darkness under bridges changes from gloom to cooling shade. After a light rain, when the slaves have come, tree limbs are like wet fingers playing in woolly green hair. Motorcars become Black jet boxes gliding behind hoodilights weakened by mist (117).\" The fluidity of the City represents the transformation of Black character: just as the objects in the city transform in a way that departs from its original nature, Blackness transforms, taking on new facets when necessary. Morrison emphasizes that the transformation of the city is not a “contradiction” but rather a “condition,” showing that different forms of Blackness exist in tandem with each other because the ability to transform is fundamental, not destructive. \n",
      "Morrison argues that as time passes, conditions change as well—Blackness can evolve within a person. The constant evolution of Blackness, although necessary, also drifts Black people from their personal sense of self. This is demonstrated in Violet whose fragmented identity is exemplified by the distinctions she makes between different parts of her persona: Violet herself and a violent, impulsive Violet (that Violet). When recalling the day she tried to attack the corpse of a murdered Dorcas, Violet distances herself from those actions by telling her story through the eyes of that Violet: “By then the usher boys were joined by drowning men who carried that kicking, growling Violet out while she looked on in amazement” (92). Morrison uses the word “she” in reference to Violet’s remembrance of this scene to signify that Violet and that Violet exist as different characters not only in time, but in physical space..  This narrative continues as Violet conveys the rest of her story through the same lens: “But if that Violet was strong and had hips, why was she proud of trying to kill a dead girl, and she was proud. Whenever she thought about that Violet, and what that Violet saw through her own eyes, she knew there was no shame in there, no disgust” (94). Morrison uses these distinctions to show that Violet and that Violet are fundamentally different characters. She deliberately writes her past narrative in third person, highlighting the distance she feels from that Violet. The phrase “her own eyes” also indicates that although Violet and that Violet technically exist in the same body, they are physically distinguishable. Consequently, Violet is unable to reconcile parts of her identity that she must claim as her own, because her unified sense of self is lost through her need to be fluid. \n",
      "When Violet is able to reconcile fragment pieces of her identity and unify her sense of self, she gains power. When Violet is able to reconcile her identity as both Violet and that Violet while reflecting on her past memories, she is fundamentally changed: “No! That Violet was not somebody walking round town, and down the streets wearing my skin and using my eyes s*** no that Violet was me! The me that hauled hay in Virginia and handled a four-mule team in the brace” (95-6). Violet realizes that not only are Violet and Violent both one in the same, but that both identities were equally impactful in shaping her identity. Violet’s mention of her life in Virginia shows how her co-existence as both Violet and that Violet existed far longer than her altercation at Dorcas’s funeral, but rather was in intrinsic part of her character. Violet doesn’t reject her multifaceted identity but rather embodies it, illustrating the power and significance of acceptance. \n",
      "Violet’s ultimate reconciliation ends on a hopeful note of laughter, which Morrison uses to show the lingering, yet strong hope that exists in those who find reconciliation within themselves. Upon coming to her realization, Violet has a conversation with True Belle, Rose Dear, and Alice, which soon gets derailed by a scene of laughter: “True Belle looked at them and had to lean against the wall to keep her laughter from pulling her down to the floor with them. They should have hated her... But what they felt was better. Not beaten, not lost. Better. They laughed too, even Rose Dear shook her head and smiled, and suddenly the world was right side up. Violet learned then what she had forgotten until this moment: That laughter is serious. More complicated, more serious than tears.” (113) Morrison emphasizes the power of laughter through her emphasis on True Belle: the phrase “they should have hated her,” exemplifies the fact that despite the tension between True Belle and her sisters, the power of laughter overcame any feelings of hate. Morrison indicates that the characters didn't feel “beaten,” showing that optimism is rooted in resilience. When Rose Dear begins to laugh alongside them, the world goes “right side up,” indicating that optimism brings stability and order. Thus, stability is found through the acceptance of fluidity because it is intrinsic to Blackness. \n",
      "    Toni Morrison’s Jazz is an exploration of Black characters that are presented with no other choice but to be fluid. Identities are rooted in sociological perception. Race and the self are societally constructed—Morrison argues that Blackness and whiteness exist not as natural nor metaphysical concepts, void for the influence of time and space, morphing with culture and their existence with each other. This is what makes gaining systemic power so hard for Black people, as they were never meant to have tangible power in a society that relies on Black subjugation to fuel the existence of whiteness. Thus, Morrison points out that they must find their power elsewhere, through the acceptance of the identity they were subjugated to. Through acceptance, there is power. Violet only comes to this realization when she accepts that inherent contradiction: she finds stability in accepting her fluidity, a sentiment that is intrinsically unstable. Ultimately, Morrison leaves the reader with a glimmer of hope: although the structures of race remain unchanging, and white oppression will not die, the reclamation of power through Black identity is what allows even the most emotionally wrecked characters to be optimistic in a racially-torn world. \n",

      "    Whenever I travel to a foreign country, my American passport reveals my identity. Gold eagle stamped on navy blue. Carrying it to visit relatives in China, I spoke English with my sister to distinguish myself as American. I, with my childish pride, knew exactly who I was: American. And therefore, despite our similar physical features, I was pointedly different from the other children I caught frogs and tadpoles with over the summer.\n",
      "    I love the familiarity of touching down on the airport runway. I love breezing past the endless line for foreign arrivals. Most of all, I love the crisp stamp and a “Welcome home!” from the U.S. customs agent. \n",
      "    However, not all other citizens, or even the president of our country, are as welcoming to my return. President Donald Trump’s designation of COVID-19 as the “Chinese Virus” makes this particularly difficult. Though the logic behind calling the virus “Chinese” would link it to the initial cases reported in Wuhan, as China was the first to weather the pandemic, this rationale fails to account for how the term “Chinese Virus” actually translates to society, where fear and confusion offer up Asian-Americans as an easy target for hate crimes. Even with the large Asian-American population in the San Francisco Bay Area, fear and unjustified hatred can be found no further than my local community, where five Asian-owned businesses were left with shattered glass doors and windows. According to San Francisco Chronicle, roughly 600 incidents of racism and discrimination against Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders related to COVID-19 took place in April in California–close to half of those were in the Bay Area (Sanchez). A quick search pulls up videos of those of East Asian descent chased with spray bottles in New York, berated on public transportation for wearing a face mask in Maryland, criminalized for coughing or waking up to a vehicle vandalized with racial slurs in Boston. \n",
      "    Calling COVID-19 the “Chinese Virus” blames the pandemic on a whole culture, their descendants and others who resemble their physical appearance. The generalization of the disease is a careless stigmatization of all Asian-Americans. Not every Chinese-American has COVID-19, and not everyone who has tested positive is of Chinese descent. In fact, the flawed logic of the term “Chinese Virus” is just one ugly stereotyping example that has been imposed on the ethnic and cultural heritage of Asian-Americans to detract them from acceptance as American.\n",
      "    To confront the coronavirus and alienation, the Chinese-American community has gone to great lengths to mobilize in slowing the virus’s spread, supporting local hospitals, donating masks and 3D printing face shields for doctors and nurses. According to the San Jose Spotlight in the San Francisco Bay Area, more than 25 Chinese-American groups had collectively fundraised over $930,000 to purchase medical supplies in the month of May by using their overseas connections to help fill a supply shortage felt throughout the country (Bitters).\n",
      "    However, there is a distinct difference between donating out of will and donating as a plea to be accepted as American. My community’s good will is misunderstood by some as a submissive gesture from the “model minority” to please a rigid system of stereotypes. Indeed, former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang advocated Asians to do just that–fulfill any stereotype demanded necessary for acceptance. In an opinion article published in the Washington Post on April 1, he encourages Asian-Americans to “show our American-ness in ways we never have before,” and suggests that the community “wear red white and blue” in order to “show without a shadow of a doubt that we are Americans who will do our part for our country” (Yang). He insists that due to their ethnic heritage, Asian-Americans must vigorously volunteer, enthusiastically wave flags, spin their tale into one of diehard patriotism, just to grasp at what their white neighbors naturally possess, the title of “American.” Yang incorrectly assumes that acceptance is something to be earned by assimilation according to the dominant order, furthering the false narrative that Asian-Americans are inherently foreign to American society.\n",
      "    As novelist Toni Morrison pointed out the truth of this strained effort to prove one’s Americanness, her words, “in this country American means white. Everybody else has to hyphenate,” still ring true. By encouraging Asian-Americans to do more to show their patriotism, Yang reinforces the idea that hyphenation does not mean fully American or fully patriotic, but instead connotes a degree of separation from what it means to be American. This gap that should not exist nevertheless does, as seen over the course of history.\n",
      "    Asian-Americans have long been pinned under the title of \"perpetual foreigner\" due to their “oriental” features and cultural heritage starting from the arrival of the earliest laborers in California. Codified as Yellow Peril, the fear of the Oriental, non-white other, dates back to the 1850s. Legislation strengthened the social consensus that peoples of Asian ancestry were incapable of assimilation and even less so acceptance. Laws such as the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act, which prohibited the immigration of Chinese laborers, and other stringent restrictions on Asian immigrants in the 1910s and 1920s such as the Asiatic Barred Zone Act of 1917, regulated even the existence of the Asian minority. As such, public perception of Asian-Americans was restricted to the monolithic Yellow Peril.\n",
      "    During World War II, after the unexpected attack on Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, Asian-Americans desperately needed to distinguish between the two parts of their hyphenation (Takaki). Their heritage was Asian, but they were American. White fear of internal enemies strengthened, and the country’s mindset was geared toward — often irrationally — pointing out “aliens” among the population.\n",
      "    This fear manifested in American public and government hurling undeserving retributions at Japanese-Americans, accusing them of supporting the Japanese government. In the name of “military necessity,” 120,000 Japanese-Americans, from adults to infants and mostly from the Pacific mainland, were removed from familiar sidewalks and loved hometowns to barren barracks furnished with Army cots and barbed wire fences (Takaki).\n",
      "    The easing of government policies in the 1940s and 1950s did not result in an embracing inclusion of Asian-Americans in the nation. As the country determined how to incorporate Asian-Americans as new citizens, a new stereotype was invented, and Asian-Americans underwent a metamorphosis by the mid-1960s as the well assimilated and politically non-threatening model minority. This dominant rhetoric cited color line and racial (often coded as cultural) difference of Japanese and Chinese to explain postwar Asian-American socioeconomic mobility, re-marking them as non-white, foreign others, effectively creating new modes of exclusion and justifying social inequalities. (Wu)\n",
      "    In such an environment, it is easy to forget that Asian-American have toiled tirelessly for America. Chinese immigrants endured back-breaking labor and uncounted casualties building the Transcontinental Railroad from 1863 to 1869. The 442nd Infantry Regiment, the most decorated military unit in American history composed of mostly second generation Japanese American soldiers, suffered 9,486 casualties during World War II. Even after countless Asian-Americans have labored and fought for this country, societal imperatives and narrative easily casts them aside as strange others in times of crisis. \n",
      "    In the late 20th century, Asian-American entrepreneurs have pioneered products for the 21st century. Yahoo, a company co-founded by Taiwanese-American programmer Jerry Yang, led the way during the onset of the Internet. NVIDIA, a company co-founded by Taiwanese-American Jensen Huang, produces processing units powering gaming software such as Minecraft. Zoom founder Eric Yuan heads a video conferencing platform used by schools, businesses and friendly gatherings throughout the pandemic. Asian-American leadership has paved the road of innovation and should not be forgotten in favor of misplaced fear. Not only have Asian-American immigrants chosen this country for its wealth of opportunities, but they have also in turn built new foundations. \n",
      "    It is not the responsibility of Asian-Americans to prove their “American-ness”. As Ronald Takaki, a former professor of Ethnic Studies at UC Berkeley, writes in “Strangers from a Different Shore,” acknowledging this country’s multicultural immigrants and diversity “would require a critical scrutiny of American society”. As citizens of this country, we, born here or naturalized, are obligated to join the collective effort to stop the virus. It is also our responsibility to call out another form of pathogens in our systems and structures. The use of “Chinese Virus”, rooted in an ugly history of racial and cultural derision, not only undermines our civility and causes social divisions but also comes at a cost to human lives during a pandemic.\n",
      "    If I stood out due to my American nationality during childhood summers in China, and if neighbors of the same nationality now solely regard me by my ethnic heritage, looking past my American identity without a thought, where do I belong? To me, this is home. You and I are both Americans, featured differently, with diverse cross-cultural roots, but committed equally to the well-being of our country. I should be able to use chopsticks and speak in Mandarin and have pride in my cultural legacy without compromising my identity as an American citizen. I display my heritage and nationality by watching the Spring Festival Gala broadcast on Chinese television during Lunar New Year, munching on a plate of dumplings, and driving up to San Francisco five months later to cheer with strangers, united under fireworks on the Fourth of July.\n",
      "    In that crowd, picture an American. Picture a Chinese person. Now, picture a girl, a product of these two cultures, sitting on a roof with a smile stretching so wide her cheeks hurt as the night rumbles awake in bursts of red, white and blue. The dark hides her black hair, her black eyes, and her tinted skin. It hides how eyeshadow refuses to pack into the crease of her upper lid as YouTube videos demonstrate, but her silhouette against the sky frames the outline of a patriot.\n",

      "    Navigating a landscape of political tensions and social unrest, Disney's live-action Mulan could not have been more timely. With a $200 million budget, it is the largest movie ever to be directed by a woman, and its all-Asian cast boasts icons—Rosalind Chao, from The Joy Luck Club and Star Trek, Cheng Pei-Pei from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Gong Li from Memoirs of a Geisha—that could have made my Chinese-American mom jump with joy (Nash Information Services).  Its release had the potential to connect people at a period of escalating U.S.-China tensions, celebrate heritage amidst a virus proclaimed \"Chinese,\" and grapple with identity inside an emerging social revolution. And yet, in spite of its unprecedented budget and cinematic grandeur, Mulan simply falls flat.\n",
      "    The film itself takes few liberties from the 1998 original. Director Niki Caro's removal of more childish features—Mushu the talking dragon, the Li Shang romance, and all its musical numbers—implies a will to take Mulan in a more mature direction, possibly closer to the original Chinese folktale of Hua Mulan. Besides that, most of the new film's storyline is the same, centering around the struggles of Mulan (Liu Yifei) to balance her family tradition and personal desire for individuality. As a child, she constantly fails to bring \"honor through marriage,\" embodied in the iconic matchmaker scene. Instead, she aspires to be a fighter and seizes her opportunity when Huns threatens the imperial palace. Mulan joins the army disguised as a man and leads her unit to victory with the power of her qi. \n",
      "    The key difference from the cartoon takes the form of evil sorceress Xianlang (Gong Li), who attempts to turn Mulan to the dark side by showing her how much they have in common. Xianlang alone, a perverse mirror to Mulan's own feminine strength, elevates the film to Caro's desired level of maturity. Not only is the tension she creates captivating, but her ornate costume and makeup speak to the talent of the production team. Indeed, the best part of Mulan lies in its visual beauty, with stunning traditional Chinese backdrops, epicly choreographed battles, and vibrant magic. The opening scene itself brings out the best of China's landscape, introducing what must be a plot as grand and beautiful as the setting itself.\n",
      "    And yet, in what The Verge calls \"the year's most beautiful letdown,\" Mulan fails (Rivera). And fails, and fails, again and again. Its plot feels forgettable, bland, and potentially even offensive. As an addition to the original, a fortuneteller reveals that Mulan's ability to lead stems from a superhuman qi. That is, the protagonist cannot control her choice to become a bold, empowered warrior. Rather, she is birthed with an abnormally high level of qi, the fortuneteller says, that women are not supposed to have. The meaning behind this is dubious—is Mulan meant to be the exception or the rule? Should young girls learn from her innate strength or accept it as unnatural? It feels as if Mulan’s supernatural powers make her inert and wooden, stripped of any room to grow as a character. Indeed, Rolling Stone describes Caro’s protagonist as “more icon than person” in contrast to the original heroine, who became beloved as a charming mix of little girl and striking heroine (Collins). \n",
      "    Of course, it would be difficult to criticize Mulan without recognizing the larger political landscape through which Caro had to maneuver. Disney Plus, the company’s new streaming service, pinned its hopes for success on the live-action to sell in China, the world’s second-largest film market. Disney practically broke its back to tailor the film to Chinese viewers, investing an entire $200 million and five years of work (Qin). However, like its predecessors Crazy Rich Asians and The Farewell, Mulan had to learn the hard way that Hollywood still has not cemented a positive reputation in China. American filmmakers struggle upon realizing that underneath its Shanghai-sophisticate veneer, Chinese culture remains largely traditional and socially conservative. For instance, in the animated version, General Li Shang became the romantic interest of Mulan. However, even before he discovered her true identity, he interacted flirtatiously with her male alter-ego Ping, leading to speculations about Li Shang’s sexuality. Today, he remains a pop culture “bisexual icon,” often considered Disney’s first major LGBTQ character. But for the remake, such a character arc would be unacceptable in a country whose more tradition-rooted culture still struggles to embrace homosexuality. As a result, Caro cut out the kiss scene between him and Mulan to pander to mainland Chinese viewers. Similarly, the wise-cracking sidekick dragon Mushu was also removed when much of China found the 1998 film overly farcical and disrespectful. Though some of these changes were met with dismay in American viewers, Disney set its hopes that Mulan would score the box-office victory they needed in China. \n",
      "    It didn’t. Caro attempted to reconcile American and Chinese values into a cohesive film and satisfied neither. The film generated $23.2 million in its opening weekend on the Chinese mainland, well below analysts’ estimates of $30 to $40 million (Nash Information Services). Its reception has varied from tepid—7.5 and 7.6 out of 10 on the Maoyan and Tao Piao Piao ticketing platforms respectively—to entirely egregious, rating a 4.9 out of 10 on the popular Douban user review site (Elegant). More lenient critics, such as 26 year-old film blogger Zhao Wen, loved the movie through its lens of “a princess movie with a little comedy and magic” (Qin). However, if one considers Mulan as Disney intended it—a blockbuster and historically monumental cultural retelling—a “princess movie” will not suffice. \n",
      "    The film is rife with historical inaccuracies, Western stereotypes, and slapdash references. The movie heroine is a Han heroine who attacks the Rouran villagers, while the actual Mulan was likely Xianbei and would not have been ruled by an emperor. The portrayal of qi is a careless and tacky take on the much more intricate concept in Chinese medicine and martial arts (Frankel 68). At one point, Mulan throws off her protective armor in battle—a dramatic gesture, perhaps, but also ludicrous logically for an “adult” film and implausible historically, as battle armor is highly regarded in China as a family heirloom. \n",
      "    Caro’s largest issue is her failure at authentic cultural representation, which one filmgoer described as a “Google Translate take of Chinese” (Qin). To me, it felt like the film’s slogan “loyal, brave, and true” is repeated ad nauseam, a poor American caricature of stiff Oriental values. As with the depersonalization of Mulan, almost all characters feel distant and cold. For me, being a Chinese-American myself, it was painful to watch the frigid and stereotypically Oriental parents parrot honor over happiness. The soldiers, while they do make a couple of jokes, lack camaraderie and banter, and Mulan herself makes no meaningful relationships outside of Xianlang. In her attempt to create a traditional setting, Caro succumbs to impersonalness and Western notions of East Asia. The result is a movie without heart, laughter, or warmth—a movie without Disney's trademark. \n",
      "    Mulan is, at its best, forgettable, and at its worst, problematic. It has all the elements of what could have been an incredible movie, but they don't feel cohesive. Instead, Caro marginalizes Xianlang's arc, raises a dubious statement on feminism, and portrays a detached, antiquated, and stereotypical mirage of China for diversity bonus points. The tangled values Caro present only further alienate American from Chinese viewers, a dangerous possibility during a revival of Cold War tensions. I can't help but wonder what could have been of Mulan if it had hired Asian screenwriters as well as actors. Or if Disney could have focused on the details before flying over its “never-done-before” $200 million banner. Or even if Caro could have chosen to protect the film’s artistic integrity, rather than pandering to the Communist Party for the sake of marketing a streaming service. One thing is for sure: it would have been better than this.  \n",

      "The Toxic Limits of Empathy\n",
      "By May Zheng \n",
      " \n",
      "For the past five months, American society has been restrained from its normal level of social interaction, whether that be in the workplace, at school, or between families and friends who don’t live together. Simultaneously, the country, and the world, has been through momentous upheaval, with COVID-19 exposing government incompetence or authoritarianism, civilians gathering in the streets to protest or riot against perceived injustices, supply chains and small businesses all but collapsing, human rights crises and chemical explosions demanding action. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now more than ever, without routinely engaging activities that necessitate focus away from our phones and computers, we are drowned in constant notifications of people being shot in the street, dying in hospitals, being discriminated against, facing homelessness and bankruptcy. As social creatures who view empathy as a virtue, humans (especially the youth with our volatile temperaments) feel obligated to constantly feel in response to everything- in the past few months, it’s more often than not outrage, sadness, disgust, despair. This impulse and these emotions are amplified by social media, a platform too accessible to have excuses to not participate in through sharing graphics, photographs, pseudo-manifestos, regarding how to, essentially, showcase caring the most. \n",
      "\n",
      "This creates a saddening paradox- we’re expected to feel everything, since not feeling supposedly is a form of complacency or perpetuating injustice. Yet, we can’t do anything tangibly significant to mitigate inevitably media-hyperbolized deaths and suffering through racism, COVID19, economic ruin. So we are left to simply stew in the emotions of others and ourselves through a screen for days, weeks, now months on end, as the world continues on its apparent highway to hell. \n",
      "\n",
      "The prolonged digital nature of news consumption and activism leads to desensitization to the issues we claim to care the most about, excarberating the exchange of negativity in the context of our political and cultural discourse. \n",
      "\n",
      "Substantial research indicates that when people are exposed repeatedly to the same stimulus, their response decreases over time on a neurological basis, specifically in the magnitude of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal activation (HPA), or our psychological and physical response to stress. This process is named habituation. Habituation speeds up in proportion to the frequency of exposure, and causes us to generalize stress-inducing stimuli along with our diluted responses. As of 2019, Americans check their phones an average of 63 times a day, with teens, the age demographic most likely participate in online activism, averaging over seven hours on their phones, so frequency of exposure is definitely over-fulfilled. As for generalization of stimuli, this can clearly be seen in the rise of tribalism and polarization skyrocketing steadily in the wake of social media, and even more so in the past few months of national unrest. Disagreeing with someone in political matters almost always ends a conversation, straining or severing relationships. Language fractalizes into dichotomies between good and evil devoid of nuance (COVID19 justifies lengthy lockdowns and economic shutdown, or is unjustifiably exaggerated as a health threat); all cops are bastards, or they’re all pure-hearted heroes; demonstrations of all kinds are justified, or all protests are to be condemned for allowing violence; systemic racism is a fundamental factor in outcome or a victimhood myth, etc. Clearly, America today enables habituation to occur on a huge scale. \n",
      "\n",
      "Multiple studies support habituation as a response to exposure to media. A study where participants watched nine violent movie scenes and nine comedy scenes found that repeated exposure to violence reduces its psychological impact in the short term, and at a higher rate than desensitization to comedy. Another study, focusing specifically on violence in the news and entertainment, using surveys from three regions of the US, found that heavy local news consumption correlates with a “blunted response to news stories regarding real-life violent events when individuals have low trait empathy.” Research from the University of Michigan followed college students over 30 years and found a 40% decrease in empathetic capabilities during this span, with the sharpest decrease after 2000, when digital technology began to enter the mainstream American lifestyle. The researchers found that social media has caused us to understand one another less (we’re less able to communicate effectively through nonverbal cues, which comprises the majority of a message, and can’t understand other perspectives as well due to less exposure to them via echo chambers). The only exception to overall emotional dilution was anger, which increased in virality and magnitude through reactionism, tribalism, and the popularity of shame. In addition, research indicates that negative emotions are more contagious than positive ones because they’re rooted in survival instincts to avoid potential threats by “catching” someone else’s fear. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our current state - ceaseless exposure to the news and our peers, dozens of contentious issues to divide us, physical isolation demanding compensation via increased digital interaction - is the perfect recipe for the hyperactive activist culture we see today, where caring for every single victim of supposed police brutality, COVID19, economic breakdown, is mandatory, or else silence is “violence” or a “privilege.” Yet this expectation is psychologically impossible and alarmingly damaging to society’s functionality. \n",
      "The idea of compassion fatigue was first coined by Charles Figley, a professor of psychology and family therapy, who described it as “we have not been directly exposed to the trauma scene, but we hear the story told with such intensity, or we hear similar stories so often, or we have the gift and curse of extreme empathy and we suffer...Eventually, we lose a certain spark of optimism, humor and hope. We tire. We aren’t sick, but we aren’t ourselves.” This definition and concept was initially applied to caretakers and therapists in regards to becoming desensitized to trauma and tragedy through decades of hearing similarly weighty stories from their patients.\n",
      "\n",
      "Compassion fatigue has been studied extensively in professional health and human services, and repeatedly result in reduced performance, absenteeism, and intentions to leave their jobs. In charities and nonprofits, volunteer turnover is extremely high because of the nature of the job- low pay for self sacrifice, in the name of empathy. Empathy has been empirically proven to be finite: the more you allocate to Thing X, the less you have for Thing Y, and feeling obligated to designate equally for a myriad of things results in feelings of emotional drainage and burden. Empathy’s limits also result in preferential empathy to those we perceive as similar to us in belief and goals, enabling the underpinnings of an aggressive us-them mentality. Most importantly, Harvard Business Review cites studies that prove that empathy easily results in eroded morals, where “people are more inclined to cheat when it serves another person,” and “it only gets worse when they empathize with another’s plight or feel the pain of someone who is treated unfairly: In those cases, they’re even more likely to lie, cheat, or steal to benefit that person.”11\n",
      "\n",
      "Empathy, when pushed to its limits, is finite, preferential, and self-rationalizing, all of which are negative. We can see all three in America today. Quarantine initially resulted in increased levels of anxiety and restlessness, before surrendering to depression and emotional exhaustion, with an underlying sense of having no control. More recently, two or three weeks after the George Floyd protests, graphics and articles began to circulate at higher rates regarding how to combat activism burnout, spelling out symptoms like lethargy, anger and hopelessness, feelings of shame and guilt for not being able to inspire significant change. Although people were initially unified by denouncing the knee of Floyd’s neck for almost nine minutes, once looting and violence began to be mixed in with protests, society began to fracture and radicalize, two distinct camps emerging of people who believe America is fundamentally racist and despicable, and those who believe America is a country built on good principles that it has been working steadily towards fulfilling since the Revolution, with racism as a declining role as a factor in achievement. People from perceived “oppressed” classes are automatically more credible and respected, as well as people who claim to be their “allies” by following constantly shifting standards of thinking and behavior, under the name of “anti-racism.” \n",
      "Self-rationalization is the most dangerous dimension of empathy. This can be seen in the justification of violence against law enforcement and non-protestors, gatherings en masse via protests being acceptable but not for parties or religion, cancel culture’s spread, warping data about black on black crime and police brutality, unilaterally condemning all white people for more implicit bias than any other race, and the notion of 2+2 = 4 being racist. As irrational, extreme things like this become acceptable in the same of social justice and equality, their overarching sentiment effectively pushes any dissent onto the defensive and into a minority, especially as they purge themselves by constantly pushing the idea that whatever anyone is doing to combat racism is never enough. \n",
      "Of course, empathy is a laudable social and neurological capability. It allows humans to strengthen our bonds with those around us, form connections with those who disagree with us through establishing other commonalities, and generally interact with people in a more positive and cooperative way. However, this great part of human nature is also the most vulnerable to exhaustion and perversion. \n",
      "Deep concern for the future of this country is warranted if legitimately toxic and unrealistic expectations continue to dictate activism. Taking breaks from consuming media and posting responses to current events needs to be normalized as a biological need - instead of looked down upon as being lazy or apathetic - in order to prevent emotional deterioration, mistreatment of others, and illogical radicalization. Mantras like “silence is violence” and “in the age of information, ignorance is a choice” can’t be accepted anymore: they set people up for (1) failure to be adequate in their ability to recite the names of every perceived victim of racism, power-abusing police officer or politician, not-woke-enough public figure, and (2) compassion fatigue that takes a personal toll and damages a person’s relationships. \n",
      "Ideally, our reserves of empathy should be redirected towards bridging gaps rather than reinforcing in-group biases, so that more of our limited energy goes moving together towards a shared vision of progress, rather than retreating further into our respective ideological corners in a delusion of complete self righteousness. \n",

      "For the successive months after the pandemic first presented itself in New York City, we ate our favorite restaurant entrees out of plastic takeout containers, with cloth-bundled silverware exchanged for single-use cutlery and a bottomless bag of napkins. The time when we would again be served in-person platters and aromatic spreads no longer seemed within close reach. As we patiently endured springtime in the city, counties in Connecticut and New Jersey gradually received an okay to re-open dining services, while New York City eateries watched in understanding but deep envy. Days under lockdown grew into weeks and months, and by June 22, Cuomo cleared New York City—the former global epicenter—for outdoor dining. The precautions that disallowed indoor service from resuming, to the dismay of struggling restaurants, were drawn from Cuomo’s fear about the warning signs “from other states on the horizon.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In anticipation of a sudden clamor for outdoor dining tables, restaurateurs scrambled to erect outdoor seating and barriers for the street space adjacent to their restaurants, transforming the city sidewalks into bustling woodworking stations. While the brick and mortar eateries were back in business, the decision to grant restaurants free rein over street space was yet another blow to New York City’s forgotten food population: street vendors. The temporary outdoor dining program, introduced at the New York City Council, has permitted restaurants to occupy plazas, sidewalks, streets, and parking lots—in many cases displacing vendor carts and street-food trucks that had been serving out of these very places for years. Forced to relocate, vendors lost many of their day-to-day patrons, a slowdown that was further perpetuated by a drastic reduction in foot traffic throughout the city during the three-month lockdown. The network of vendor carts around my high school, Stuyvesant, for one, rely on a midday rush of students—a demographic of customers who have not spent a dime at these same carts since the March closure of the school building. \n",
      "\n",
      "Vendors have already been economically underserved by the government throughout the course of the pandemic: a large fraction of the city vendor population is comprised of undocumented immigrants who were not afforded stimulus checks back in April. A resilient group of 20,000 hardworking individuals who serve much of the working class in the city, vendors are rarely represented in local legislation and are often overlooked by lawmakers in Albany. This precedent of hostility toward street vendors was cemented by a 1981 law that capped the number of street vendor permits at 5,000, essentially whittling down the industry to an elite hobby, not a passage for the American Dream. The mismanaged vendor license system, which emerged out of this antiquated legislation, has forced aspiring vendors to pay up to $18,000 for a retail $200 permit in order to sell legally out of their carts. The strict cap on vendor permit availability, which has remained unchanged for four decades, has not kept pace with the extensive population growth of the city and has authorized over-policing of vendors. Evelia Coyotzi, a tamale vendor in Corona, Queens, was arrested more than 15 times, not for breaking well-defined laws and rules, but for selling her authentic Tlaxcalan cuisine in the wrong place at the wrong time—namely, an era during which the police and former mayor Rudy Giuliani reportedly did not want a single vendor on the streets. \n",
      "\n",
      "A community that has long been subject to Albany’s cold shoulder, street vendors now have a chance to pass legislation that would support the industry in a period of unprecedented need—Intro 1116. Council members Margaret Chin and Carlos Menchaca pioneered a bill that would “aim to bring increased opportunities, fairness, and consistent enforcement to a chaotic system created by a decades-old cap that has forced many vendors to turn to an underground market for licenses.” Intro 1116 would directly expand the availability of vending permits, implement an official vendor advisory board, and create an office for street vendor enforcement. \n",
      "\n",
      "As a New York City student with a fixed budget, I understand that the street vendor population in our city is indispensable; my go-to orders at the halal and Korean food carts have stayed fresh on my mind even after a six-month hiatus. The vendors themselves were more than just faces I would pass as I trekked down the white-collar neighborhood of TriBeCa—I exchanged daily greetings and smiles, and they knew my order at the mere sight of me. For all of the affordable lunches that they served to me, it is now my obligation to support the bill that might very well keep their businesses alive in these troubled times. These vendors deserve more than our thoughts and prayers—they need decisive action. \n",
      "\n",
      "If your life has been bettered by a street vendor, or if you want to protect these resolute workers with families and dreams, I urge you to take to the following actions: call your council member and urge them to support Intro 1116; call Corey Johnson, the speaker of the New York City Council, and remind him that you care about street vendors in our city; and, finally, try to buy your next meal from a local street vendor. They have always been there for us at our every convenience—now imagine a New York City without them.\n",

      "Recent decades have been characterized by the slowly declining influence of the United States and the long-anticipated rise of China to superpower status. China’s rapid economic growth since the enactment of market-oriented reforms in 1978 has lifted more than 850 million Chinese out of extreme poverty, built an enormous export-oriented economy, and driven average Chinese incomes up (World Bank). Yet recent drops in GDP (Gross Domestic Product) growth point towards a slowing export sector and an unfavorable geopolitical situation (World Bank). Rising wages and a severe demographic crisis are putting immense pressure on China’s export-oriented economy, which relies heavily on cheap labor. External pressures are also mounting on China’s economy; now more than ever, the West sees China’s growth as a threat. The Chinese export economy suffers from renewed hostility, trade wars, and even suspicion over the COVID-19 pandemic’s origin. \n",
      "\n",
      "All of these discouraging factors beg the question: what can China do about its economy? The reality is that the country has only one option: to place emphasis on domestic consumption and to shrink the export industries. This would transition the country’s economy closer to those of wealthy importers, such as the United States. However, increasing domestic consumption necessitates a stronger, wealthier middle class and more support for businesses; it requires freer financial institutions. Lastly, China needs a cutting-edge innovation sector that can compete with other global producers. Yet China’s authoritarian system, which suffers from wasteful government spending, corrupt elite interests, and impediments to technological growth, will most likely prevent all endeavors to transition to a domestic consumption economy. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Decline of the Export Economy\n",
      "\n",
      "China’s economic model is extremely unique. The term that describes China best, ‘state capitalism,’ appears to be an oxymoron. The authoritarian central government coexists with a thriving market economy, a combination that appears to possess the best of two worlds: capitalist productivity and authoritarian supervision. Instead of following the Western liberal model, China believes that it has carved a new path to success. Furthermore, the country markets its state capitalism as a viable and attractive alternative to democratic capitalism. The only proof China needs is its existence: it is one of the world’s largest economies and its sphere of influence grows as each day passes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Chinese Communist Party, or the CCP, has virtually complete control of the Chinese government. The CCP maintains its legitimacy by ensuring economic growth, which placates the Chinese population to some extent. Therefore, one of the CCP’s highest priorities is to continue economic growth and to avoid stagnation. However, in recent years China’s economy has experienced a notable slowdown. China’s GDP growth had averaged about 10 percent for many decades; in past years, annual GDP growth has slowed from a peak of 14 percent in 2004 to a low of just 6 percent in 2019 (World Bank). This significant drop can be attributed to the now-outdated export model on which China built its fortune.\n",
      "\n",
      "Three reasons stand out for why the Chinese export sector is in decline: an incoming demographic crisis, rising wages, and external hostility. The availability of cheap labor in China decreases every year due to negative demographic trends that have plagued the country since the notorious ‘One-Child Policy.’ The policy limited the number of children a couple could legally have to just one. Even after Beijing reversed the policy in late 2015, many families chose not to have a second child due to economic concerns, and rising prices around the country have left swaths of Chinese couples behind. The country’s overall birth rate declined dramatically after the enactment of the one-child policy, and the current Chinese fertility rate in 2020 is approximately 1.69 children per woman. Experts predict that annual Chinese population growth will continue to decline in the next few decades to the point that there soon will not be enough workers to support the aging population (Myers et al.). Also, China’s economic boom has rapidly increased worker wages, and as a consequence, many companies are outsourcing to cheaper locations such as Sri Lanka. Finally, more countries in the U.S.-led coalition are taking a harder stance on China. Notably, the ongoing trade war with the U.S. adds the extra burden of tariffs on imported Chinese goods. \n",
      "\n",
      "The only remedy to a declining export economy is to transition to an economy driven by internal consumption and innovation. Recognizing the necessity of this transition, the CCP has recently unveiled a new ‘dual circulation’ economic strategy which is part of the party’s 14th Five-Year-Plan. The plan emphasizes the transition to a domestic consumption economy aimed to boost the growing middle class of roughly 400 million Chinese. More concretely, the CCP wants to lessen dependence on imports and raise per-capita GDP to match moderately developed countries such as South Korea or Israel. The plan also highlights domestic technological development as an important objective (Sutter et al.). However, the feasibility of this strategy should be called into question. Given the political environment and authoritarianism prevalent in China, the plan’s ambitious goals to transition the economy will most likely never come to fruition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Authoritarian Barriers: Wasteful spending, SOEs, and the Elite Officialdom\n",
      "\n",
      "To transition to a domestic consumption economy, the CCP must emphasize domestic growth by allocating resources towards productive businesses and beneficial developments. However, the inefficient authoritarian nature of the CCP and its state-owned enterprises (SOEs) could impede any effort to transition. Effective resource allocation is not one of the CCP’s strengths; the party has a long record of wasteful expenditures. Although the CCP has attempted to stimulate domestic consumption and productivity by increasing internal spending, much of that spending has been wasted on useless infrastructure and clunky SOEs, rather than private enterprises and the middle class (Fisher). \n",
      "\n",
      "Structural overinvestment plagues Chinese housing and infrastructure developments. Most ghost towns formed when people moved out, but China’s ghost cities formed when no one moved in. A nationwide study in 2017 based on the China Household Finance Survey found that approximately 22.4 percent of homes in China are unoccupied; in comparison, the U.S. home vacancy rate in the same year was just 12.7 percent (Blazyte). Regional airports and highways are also underutilized, and many Chinese provinces that borrowed huge sums of money to pay for these projects are now in severe debt (Buckley). We can look towards China’s fragile real estate bubble as a partial explanation for the high vacancy rate; government-led property developers in China believe that the demand will keep going up, which will certainly not be true once the bubble bursts. The government-driven housing bubble severely hurts the average Chinese consumer. Recently, economists at Moody’s Analytics pointed out that Chinese disposable income has grown at about 10 percent annually for the past six years while household debt has grown at about double the rate, and much of that debt is related to housing. The low disposable income suggests that even if Beijing transitioned China to a domestic consumption economy, consumers would not have enough to spend.\n",
      "\n",
      "China’s excessive infrastructure construction vastly increases debt every year; Chris Buckley from the New York Times writes that “the cost-benefit ratio of each new mile of asphalt drops sharply.” Even worse, Oxford professor Atif Ansar examined 65 Chinese highway and rail projects in a study and found that less than a third were productive (Buckley). Most of these projects are supervised on the local level, meaning that local officials have the largest stake in infrastructure. Why would officials take the risk to fund projects that are not worth their price tag? Three reasons stand out. First, officials can receive millions of dollars in various benefits for giving out contracts to certain companies, also known as bribery. They get away undetected because China possesses neither a financial disclosure system nor an effective anti-corruption practice (W. Chen). Second, officials can receive career benefits for building large projects, even if the projects are not economical. Third, government backing ensures that the construction companies and the local government will not default nor go bankrupt even when they are deeply in debt (Buckley). Simple economics shows us that supplying a service does not ensure demand. Rather than boost the middle class and businesses, the CCP wastes money on largely useless infrastructure, proving its incompetence in transitioning to a domestic consumption economy.\n",
      "The CCP also controls Chinese SOEs, which are a distinctive part of the Chinese economy (Guluzade). Although SOEs have brought many jobs to the country, they are undoubtedly inefficient. SOEs, by definition, are led by the CCP and their top priority is to serve the party. This means that they have to operate under special policy burdens which can lead to contradicting objectives, hiring of redundant workers, and other wasteful consequences. Even worse, SOEs have a ‘soft budget,’ meaning that the government will bail them out through fiscal subsidies and tax cuts (Asia Dialogue). Because of this financial security, they lose the drive to become ‘leaner and meaner’ that private sector companies possess. Also, banks tend to loan to SOEs more often than to private companies because SOEs have government backing; this pushes the balance in favor of state control rather than private control, creating an unfair playing ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "The data shows that SOEs are much less productive than their private counterparts. They account for a huge portion of non-financial corporate debt and are heavily reliant on government funding (Asia Dialogue). Studies comparing thousands of firms have repeatedly shown that SOEs are, on average, less profitable than private companies (Thi et al.). Even though the CCP has attempted to reform SOEs, Chinese SOE reforms are widely regarded as unsuccessful, and in some cases completely failing (Asia Dialogue).\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the interests of the elite may be the greatest obstacle that the CCP faces to transition to a domestic consumption economy. In China, the line between officialdom and business interests is practically nonexistent. Many corrupt government officials have earned their private fortunes through political positions and powerful SOEs. These officials tend to be regional party members that greatly benefit from SOEs and the export economy. Also, because local officials have a certain degree of autonomy from Beijing, they can diverge from the national policy if they think it is in their interest to do so. This means that the Chinese officialdom could easily resist changes that harm their interests. A new domestic market driven by middle-class consumers would require a transfer of wealth from SOEs and the elite to the middle class, and Beijing would certainly face tremendous opposition if it attempts to transition to a domestic consumption economy (Fisher).\n",
      "\n",
      "Systemic Impediments to Technological Growth\n",
      "\n",
      "Without a doubt, technology forms the backbone of productivity growth. Robust innovation drives countries forward and boosts production. For China to transition to a domestic consumer economy, it needs to become a global leader in technology and nurture a thriving education and innovation environment. The CCP has tried to encourage technological growth, yet fundamental issues with authoritarianism and inefficient fund allocation continue to stifle the Chinese technology sector.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first impediment lies with the infamous Chinese Great Firewall. Named the ‘Golden Shield,’ this massive government firewall not only restricts dissent but also Chinese researchers’ access to outside information. The firewall blocks sites commonly found in the U.S. such as YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Gmail (vpnMentor). Important web resources such as Google Scholar are also blocked. The result is that Chinese researchers and scholars are not able to easily access foreign research, which could otherwise aid them greatly. In addition, the Golden Shield, as an anonymous Chinese astronomer said, makes “international collaboration difficult and damages the reputation and competitiveness of Chinese science institutes” (Normile).\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, China’s patent incentive system requires extensive reform. The country claims the title of most new patents annually, but in 2018, Bloomberg reported that according to JZMC Patent and Trademark data, about 91 percent of five-year-old Chinese patents produced in 2013 were discarded by 2018 (WIPO). The Bloomberg article goes on to note two key points. First, U.S. patents are still of considerably better quality than their Chinese counterparts; because the CCP rewards innovation based on patent filings, many research institutions choose to create useless patents to appear highly productive so that they can receive funding. The second point, as stated in the article, is that “the high disposal rates mean China still has a long way to go till it becomes the technologically sophisticated nation it aspires to be” (L. Chen).\n",
      "\n",
      "To compensate for a lack of internal innovation, the CCP heavily utilizes technology theft. However, an increasingly hostile international environment suggests that it will not be able to sustain this theft nor easily acquire foreign technology for long. FBI Director Christopher Wray recently stated that the bureau currently had about 1,000 open investigations of technology theft related to China (Wray). Although the CCP claims to be pushing for technological autonomy, it continues to leech technology from other nations. For example, the CCP’s Thousand Talents Program entices top scientists and engineers in numerous Western countries with lucrative financial incentives. In return, many participants inappropriately share their research and technology with Chinese entities, costing affected enterprises and organizations billions of dollars (Wray). However, recent U.S. crackdowns on suspected technology theft and restrictions on student/scholar visas point towards a future where China won’t be able to sustain technological growth by stealing other nations’ ideas.\n",
      "\n",
      "The CCP wants to turn China into a technological powerhouse capable of competing with cutting-edge developed nations. However, the productive and independent technology ecosystem necessary to achieve this goal requires foundational changes in the current Chinese technology regime at the legal and societal level. Wired Magazine’s Geremie Barme and Sang Ye observed that “the technology China needs to build the most powerful country on Earth in the 21st century threatens to undermine the institutions that rule the nation” (Barme et al.). Without a thriving, independent technology sector, China’s path to a domestic consumption economy will remain unclear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "In short, a massive ideological contradiction impedes the CCP’s ability to transition China to a domestic consumption economy. The CCP is an authoritarian entity that maintains order and stability with top-down control, unlike liberal democracies that are open to criticism and bottom-up change. The government needs to provide more resources to true innovators and the private sector, but SOEs and inefficient fund distribution block the path. It must provide more power to the growing middle class to create domestic growth, but then the reluctant party and its ruling elite would have to lessen some of their power. The heart of the contradiction lies in the very nature of China’s government. It is simply impossible for the CCP to build and reform the institutions needed to transition its economy while placating party officials and maintaining its dominion over the Chinese people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, although China’s troublesome transition is a critical issue, the CCP faces an even greater threat to its continued reign: the people of China appear to have recognized the CCP’s unequal and oppressive nature. Social unrest cases in China have become more frequent every year since the 1990s, but the CCP continues to employ a ruthless combination of stringent online censorship, heavy surveillance, and police repression to stop activism and discontent at its source (Slaten). Accounts of Chinese human rights activists ‘disappearing’ have startled both the international community and everyday Chinese citizens. Ever since the economic reforms four decades prior, inequality has skyrocketed and will likely get worse. If the CCP cannot transition China’s economy and continues supporting the wealthy elite over the common people, then severe social instability is certain to follow. And as scholars of history know, the collapse of a society often begins with its people.\n",

      "Freedom of Religion v. Public Health: Evaluating the Risks of Religious Gatherings During the Coronavirus Pandemic\n",
      "In 1905, the United States Supreme Court decreed that, “In every well-ordered society charged with the duty of conserving the safety of its members, the rights of the individual in respect of his liberty may at times, under the pressure of great dangers, be subjected to such restraint, to be enforced by reasonable regulations, as the safety of the general public may demand” (Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 1905). While the Supreme Court uttered these words over a century ago, its implications concerning personal liberties in a time of crisis have surprising relevance to the current dispute over religious gatherings during the coronavirus pandemic. Although the United States Constitution was undoubtedly created as a guide for future leaders to refer to in tumultuous times, judicial precedents have enabled the government to accommodate unforeseen events that require the flexibility of this document. These juxtaposing ideas produce an important question: To what extent should certain constitutional freedoms yield for the greater public good when those very freedoms put Americans in danger of losing their lives?\n",
      "   A very recent Supreme Court decision, Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn, New York v. Andrew M. Cuomo, issued on November 25, 2020, addresses exactly this question, by evaluating the coronavirus restrictions placed on houses of religious worship by the state of New York. The New York law sought to control the spread of the coronavirus by restricting the number of people permitted in a church, synagogue or other house of worship at any given time. Although the pandemic certainly constitutes as an aberrant time, the Supreme Court ruled in a 5-4 decision that the protection measures could not be enforced, and in order to protect freedom of religion, religious gatherings must be allowed to continue unrestricted. Choosing to overlook the blatant health risks associated with these congregations, the Supreme Court’s ruling sets forth a dangerous precedent—one that holds that, unlike the 1905 Jacobson v. Massachusetts decision, religious gatherings are more important than public safety. \n",
      "\n",
      "The undeniable truth of today’s pandemic is that the coronavirus itself has no leniency: It doesn’t care if a victim has a family to support or pre-existing health conditions, and it certainly doesn’t avoid gatherings, even when they have religious importance. With more than 280,000 deaths in the U.S attributed to the virus to date, statistics indicating the start of a second-wave are causing grave concern. Mirroring this new wave of the pandemic, New York City’s positive cases have increased to 5.7% according to the CDC Covid Data Tracker, indicating the need for greater restrictions, or at least the power to downsize gatherings if the turn for the worse continues. And New York is not alone—the same danger is unfolding across the nation. Yet, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn, New York v. Andrew M. Cuomo ruling represents the antithesis of the direction in which the country should be heading. With more than 650 cases (as of July) directly traced to religious gatherings since the start of the pandemic, there is a clear connection between non-restricted houses of worship and the spread of the coronavirus (Conger). The stark reality is that religious gatherings, especially those held indoors, are optimal settings for the virus to spread, and without any limitations on the number of attendees, the end to the pandemic moves further out of sight. \n",
      "  Unfortunately, the discussion has taken on a political element as the now conservative Supreme Court, seeking to assert unequivocal religious rights, utilized the lawsuit to overturn a previous ruling made just months earlier in the pandemic. A 5-4 decision in the California case, South Bay United Pentecostal Church v. Gavin Newsom, ruled the opposite way: in favor of limiting religious congregations, on the basis that it was a permissible method to control the spread of the deadly virus. With the only real explanation for the reversal being that the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg (who was among the justices still on the court in June when South Bay was decided), has since been replaced with conservative Amy Coney Barrett, it is clear that the most recent Supreme Court decision was based more on the judges’ political agendas and less on the moral viewpoint of the Court in its entirety. Referring to the Court’s overt partisanship,  New York Governor Andrew Cuomo suggested that the decision was centered upon the Court’s desire to send a message about its new balance of power. He stated, “you have a different court, and I think that was the statement that the court was making” (McKinley & Stack). The Governor’s idea is accentuated by the fact that the decision had no practical impact, because the restrictions in question had already been lifted. Yet, while the decision had little pragmatic effect, the implications of a partisan court and its superfluous assertion of religious exemptions, especially during an ever-worsening pandemic, have immense, negative ramifications. \n",
      "\n",
      "When examining the Supreme Court’s constitutional argument, certain discrepancies become clear. In the earlier Supreme Court case, South Bay United, the application of the Free Exercise Clause came into question. The clause essentially states that federal and state governments cannot prohibit the free exercise of religion. However, certain legal precedents show that this right is not absolute and that there are notable exceptions to the law. For instance, in the 1990 case, Employment Division v. Smith, the Supreme Court ruled that, “the right of free exercise does not relieve an individual of the obligation to comply with a valid and neutral law of general applicability...if it does not ‘target’ specific types of religious exercise...but prohibits specific activities...the government can apply that law...without violating the First Amendment’s Free Exercise Clause”( Employment Division v. Smith). In other words, the government has the power to restrict religious activities in order to promote a general law as long as it doesn’t single out religion from other groups. Clearly, Governor Cuomo’s attempt at restrictions in New York City did not have any malevolent intentions of discrimination, but rather sought to protect the community. Justice Roberts, in South Bay United, reflected this same sentiment: “Although California’s guidelines place restrictions on places of worship, those restrictions appear consistent with the free exercise clause of the First Amendment” (Liptak). Such reasoning shouldn’t change in an almost identical context barely six months later. Clearly, the recent Supreme Court decisions reveal an inconsistency in the proper interpretation of the Constitution.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, the dispute taps into the constant struggle between civil liberties and public safety. When the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn and two Orthodox Jewish organizations complained about the violation of their alleged Free Exercise rights and claimed a disproportionate amount of restrictions on religious communities, they created a First Amendment-oriented debate. They argued that New York's rule capping religious gatherings at ten people violated the First Amendment to the U.S.Constitution. The Supreme Court agreed, concurring that, “In [Cuomo’s] judgment laundry and liquor, travel and tools, are all ‘essential’ while traditional religious exercises are not. That is exactly the kind of discrimination the First Amendment forbids” (Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn, New York v. Andrew M. Cuomo). At the same time, the Constitution also guarantees a right to peaceful assembly, which has obviously, and beneficially, been curtailed due to social distancing necessities. Such an inconsistency underscores that the government does indeed have the power to adjust certain constitutional measures in a time of crisis. The religious aspect of this case, however, adds a dimension of potential discrimination, in which the plaintiff has argued that religious congregations should be equated to that of essential businesses or else the situation is an iniquitous bias. Justice Gorsuch agreed, stating that, “while the pandemic poses many grave challenges, there is no world in which the Constitution tolerates color-coded executive edicts that reopen liquor stores and bike shops but shutter churches, synagogues and mosques'' (Liptak). This comparison is a very black-and-white description of essential businesses, one that simply ignores the alarmingly high number of coronavirus cases traceable to large gatherings. Justice Gorsuch also oversimplifies the function of essential businesses, which in reality do not encourage crowding nearly as much as religious services do. If the pandemic has shown the world anything, it is that coronavirus cases tend to be concentrated in certain areas and drastic measures are required to reduce their impact. This truth therefore requires a more fluid application of legislation, in order to alleviate hotspots and super-spreader events. Instead of labeling religious gatherings as essential, the five-judge majority in the Supreme Court should have looked at the situation through a lens focused more on the public welfare than on individual rights. With gatherings at even essential business having to be limited in number for public safety,  “Houses of worship must [also] practice social distancing to ensure that room remains for the few necessary exceptions” (Inazu). Thus, the Free Exercise Clause should be applied to a limited extent, as echoed by the director for the American Civil Liberties Union’s freedom of religion and belief program who said: “The freedom to worship is one of our most cherished fundamental rights, but it does not include a license to harm others or endanger public health” (McKinley & Stack). While the First Amendment protects important rights, in times of great danger, those individual rights certainly become more tenuous, and the present pandemic makes it clear that some gatherings just need to be restricted. \n",
      "\n",
      "Much like a stone thrown into a pond, allowing public gatherings of any sort will have a rippling effect on the spread of the coronavirus and the potential for serious illness and death. As the country faces a crucial period in which the virus is either handled or intensified, curtailing these gatherings takes on immense importance. And while the history of civil liberties—including religious gatherings—in times of danger is constantly fluctuating, the country should err on the side of protecting public health instead of pushing a partisan agenda at the expense of human lives. More than a century of legal precedents support such an idea, and prove that the recent Supreme Court decision in Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn, New York v. Andrew M. Cuomo is amiss. \n",

      "Of Death in a Global Pandemic\n",
      "            “Men fear death, as children fear to go in the dark; and as that natural fear in children is increased with tales, so is the other.” - Francis Bacon “Of Death” \n",
      "\n",
      "Most children don’t fear death because the concept is so foreign to them. As described, their fear rests in natural, seemingly insignificant things such as the dark or clowns - fears they haven’t quite come to understand yet. Physical fears often diminish with age, paving the way for more abstract, intangible fears to grow in their place. Deep-rooted fears, previously buried under the quickly melting iceberg of innocence, such as failure, embarrassment, or death, bubble up to the surface, muting mundane fears until they are no more than slight discomfort.\n",
      "\n",
      "As life goes on, death draws nearer and nearer until it finally shakes hands with us. The unlucky ones greet death prematurely, taking an early ride on death’s unmerciful and unstoppable carriage. Once death makes its cold, definitive choice, it condemns a person to their last living appointment. Accepting this truth, death may grow into an intangible fear or remain as undisputed truth, helping us live relatively unaffected. Those who’ve surpassed half a century in age often accept death with only a bit of chagrin, while those barely into two decades of life are worried their natural proximity to death has started showing on their visage. As the individual ability to deal with fear varies based on age or nature, our emotional responses to both death and fear are compatible. We fear death for our loved ones just as we fear death for ourselves. Dealing with death is a universal experience; we handle it separately but together, mourning individually while surrounded by those closest to us. Contemporary society has recognized death as a singular yet unifying force resulting in modern portrayals of death no longer remaining consistently grotesque, horrid, or simply sorrowful. Compared to the renaissance or even a few decades ago, we’ve learned to accept death as we learn to accept our fears. Living in fear of death is not truly living. Expecting that final appointment before experiencing any pre-existing symptoms prevents us from ever having a real shot of acceptance or a friendly acquaintance with death. \n",
      "\n",
      "These acquaintances with death are prevalent on a newly consistent worldly scale. Very rarely does the globe harmoniously comprehend a similar fear of death; in war, civil unrest, famine, and pandemic. In these times, death no longer remains an appointment but rather evolves into a devastating cloud looming over all heads. In this recent pandemic, death pollutes an aspect of life everyone thought was safe: air. Rather than penetrating in multiple, inconceivable occurrences, death now comes in a singular method, though still affecting everyone differently. Skeptics hold little regard for this new precipice of death, appearing headstrong and brave until death’s friend and often helper greets them at their door. On the other hand, those overly worried or superstitious forget to live. They’re safe, and although mocked by skeptics, they remain secluded; protected but in hiding from death, friends, and family, dealing only with an illness growing in their mind. The middle section is quite broad or expansive. Some take risks: staying safe except for a few momentary lapses in judgment. Some focus on seclusion with bouts of life: moving outside, maintaining interactions without immediate fear. Some stay in the dead middle, which in reality, is a vast gray area. The gray area takes risks to experience some semblance of normalcy and life, yet understands and more importantly accepts the consequences of the currently indefinite yet coming finite normal with responsibility and courage. \n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, those with reining power suddenly harness some control over the spread of death during these times. In war, the casualties are on their conscience. In a pandemic, the spread remains in their control. A few leaders believe they are mini Napoleons considering they are the few who take bold risks, but their actions work at the expense of others. Even when death came knocking at their doors or one of death’s companions said “Hello,” these supposed champions of their people remained resistant. For better or for worse, these leaders must protect the world in a pandemic, providing death and friends with a new sparring mate. \n",
      "In the end, however, death will find victory somewhere. Leaders can, will, and have failed in their unnatural battles against death. Global citizens fight alone while living in fear as the friend of death illness turns right around the corner. It is established that no one can conquer death in fiction, taught that death is often inevitable in science, and accepted by those who are up there in years. Throughout this all, it is a universal truth that living in fear of death will not save us from it. It is our choices that urge us closer to death while simultaneously urging us further into the depths of life. \n",

      "Of Beauty During the Rule of Social Media \n",
      "            “Virtue is like a rich stone, best plain set; and surely virtue is best in a body that is comely, though not of delicate features; and that hath rather dignity of presence, than beauty of aspect.” - Francis Bacon, “Of Beauty” \n",
      "\n",
      "If beauty should equal virtue, then every celebrity famous for their looks should be the most charitable, most caring, and most compassionate soul to walk to the Earth. Social media influencers and gurus create the standards of physical beauty today, rather than artists of the Renaissance, and often leave out reminders of true inner beauty. Idealized inner beauty is no longer promoted by the wise and experienced members of society but rather by students and young adults who have barely left education. These young people preach mental health, smart decisions, and positivity all while turning themselves into hypocrites when they reveal how much they’ve struggled with negativity, stress, anxiety, or depression, and in some cases, bad choices. Unfortunately, these misfortunes are not their fault. These influencers gain their position, not by positive words, honesty, or truth, but by shares and likes on a screen. Their podium to preach was manufactured by commercial love and appreciation created by the masses who dote upon a filtered image of beauty as if it was reality. Therefore, that filter, a falsified version of outer beauty, transforms into truth, almost gospel to some people, and their adoration of outer beauty sometimes reflect their lack of inner beauty or virtue. \n",
      "\n",
      "As a result, commercialized beauty, created by machines and algorithms, is easy to corrupt. Its power takes a hold of young people in two ways. One: that they become infatuated with numbers, shares, likes, and followers. They care about creativity of course, but after they use filters and stage posts until reality becomes less and less. Like after like, share after share, follow after follow creates an impenetrable algorithm cycling out a new standard of beauty for these children and teenagers to meet day after day. We call the idealized beauty of the Renaissance created by practiced artists art, but codes, numbers, machines, and math sets the standard of beauty now. Can mathematical beauty be called art?  Two: that beauty has the most negative effect on young people of all. They begin to lose their real self-image, caring more about numbers online or numbers associated on a scale instead of the numbers of friends surrounding them. Rather than eating, their obsession with unattainable, ever-changing physical beauty eats them up inside. It’s shocking, amazing, and heartbreaking all watching young people, including myself, decide to value themselves based on a number, rather than on charity, affections, or honesty. This mathematical equation generating idealized beauty doesn’t affect everyone equally, yet it has affected everyone in some form or another whether first or second hand as a result of the all-encompassing web of social media. \n",
      "\n",
      "Achieving complete and total excellence in beauty remains an impossible feat to this day as it was years ago. Beauty constantly changes throughout history, both internally and externally, whether depicted with color and value in art or manufactured through algorithms and numbers of likes. Personality traits, mannerisms, and demeanors valued in the 1600s no longer hold the same importance and qualities of today. The evolution of societies and cultures constantly impacts what we view as both physical and intangible qualities of beauty. The chivalry policy of the Middle Ages and courting protocols of the Regency Era seem dramatic and outdated today just as the manner of speaking and relaxed physicalities commonly practiced in the 21st century appear crass and inappropriate even by 1950s standards. Inner beauty and virtue changes as much as physical beauty, but with less outward consequences. Those who constantly pursue the ever-evolving standard of perfected beauty, particularly young people and children, will inevitably be let down. Beauty is as fickle as the people who worship it, making the pair a seemingly ideal couple as they constantly change appearances together. Therefore, the claim remains true that valuing inner beauty and virtues above outer beauty and physicality will most likely result in a more fulfilled and dignified lifestyle, including all delicate emotions and hardships without the mental strain of striving for perfection. \n",

      "Living Through America’s Time-Old Problems in 2020\n",
      "  I first picked up Jeffrey Eugenides’s novel Middlesex over summer break. Upon reading the summary on the book’s back cover — the multi-generational story of a Greek-American intersex man’s discovery of identity and his family’s immigration from Asia Minor to America — I hadn’t expected to find much of myself in its chapter. However, as I read about the Stephanides family’s escape to the states, Calliope or Cal’s assimilation and alienation from American culture, and the historic civil rights events that took place in Prohibition-Era Detroit, the past nine months of quarantine and unrest sank in in a new way.\n",
      "  I was born and raised in Michigan. My entire life, my Chinese ethnicity did not affect my daily happenings or how people perceived me; that is, until COVID-19 hit early this year. Propelled by President Trump’s calling the pandemic the “Chinese virus” and “kung flu,” the U.S. experienced an alarming rise in xenophobia against Asian Americans, with racist attacks being inflicted upon people on the streets as well as online. I read many horrific articles about bloodied Asian American victims, some of them elderly men and women, who suffered at the heel of public hysteria, misinformation, and hate; but, perhaps because I so deeply trusted my Americanness, I never fathomed that I’d face the same treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "One July day, my family decided to take a drive up to upstate Michigan to break the monotony of quarantine. When I stepped out of the car to enter a store, I immediately felt many angry eyes glaring at me, watching my every move. Or were they? I couldn’t tell if the eyes on me were of racists, preparing to attack, or if they were a figment of the paranoia that those xenophobic events had implanted in me. Immediately, I was filled with fear, embarrassment, and lividity — an aggregation of all the feelings that I’d tried to suppress for the past few months.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like the teenage Calliope, “I had always felt completely American” (298); but, for the first time, I’m painfully aware that I’m not welcome as an “American” because of my ethnicity and, to some, I’m nothing more than a potential virus-carrying heathen who should “go back to China” or “go to hell.” I now know what Calliope meant when she said that, at Baker & Inglis, “[a]ll of a sudden American wasn’t about hamburgers and hot rods anymore. It was about the Mayflower and Plymouth Rock” (298). Calliope and I can assimilate to and love and serve America, despite us being “ethnic girls.” However, we will never have the charm bracelet that qualifies us as true Americans, the bracelet being whiteness. For a while, it was difficult to accept that I would likely never be viewed as “true American,” because there “was another America to which we could never gain admittance” (298).\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, discrimination and scapegoating in this country are nothing new. Eugenides writes of the infamous 1967 Detroit Riots, which started when police raided and arrested patrons of a nightclub where a civil rights group was convening. In retaliation, black citizens looted stores and destroyed property, which led to the US Army troops being dispatched to Detroit and then slaughtered rioters. Cal says of this incident: “Our neighborhood’s basic feeling about our fellow Negro citizens could be summed up [as]: ‘[T]hey can speak perfectly normal if they want.’ We weren’t prejudiced against them. We wanted to include them in our society if they would only act normal!” (240).\n",
      "\n",
      "When I read this passage, I wanted to ask Cal how he expected black Americans to act “normal” when “normalcy” would only lead to many more centuries of oppression, thwarted opportunity, and social and systemic injustice. Yes, looting may be unlawful; but standing by in silence while watching children, men, and women of one’s race be killed at the hands of white supremacists is delusional and definitely not normal. As Cal said himself, “Normality wasn’t normal. It couldn’t be. If normality were normal, everyone [would] leave it alone” (446).\n",
      "\n",
      "The painful reality is that black Americans, even if they were to act completely normal, would not be free from harassment and even death. My best friend and sailing partner Christopher, a tall, buff and sweet African-American boy, always wears a 3-piece suit under his dry suit when we sail. I used to laugh when he told me his mom said he needed to dress nicely and could never wear a black hoodie, since some people would treat him as a criminal. I now understand what he meant - the idea of social justice is a dream to my friend and many African-American citizens who have to face the prevalence of racial violence in their daily lives. I couldn’t laugh any more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amidst the pandemic and the rising death toll as well as the Black Lives Matter movement and the extreme violence that fell upon those peaceful protesters, my reading of Middlesex was a deeply saddening one. The maltreatment that Eugenides recounts from over 60 years ago continues to afflict minorities today. And we are only now beginning to truly probe the “principles” that make American culture and society “great.”\n",

      "Restless on the church floor, Paul D can not help but feel Beloved’s presence – a nagging, pulsating reminder. Even after the many nights removed from her gaze, Beloved lives, inescapable, in Paul D’s mind. Beloved by Toni Morrison details the haunting of 124 Bluehouse Lane – home to Sethe, a runaway slave, and plagued by the incandescent memories of enslavement. As a byproduct of its lyrical magical realism, Beloved blurs the readers’ grasp of time and thus reality itself. Particularly, this ambiguity surrounds Beloved – the young woman Morrison portrays as the physical embodiment of Sethe’s murdered child. However, the rememory Beloved’s arrival sparks places this character’s true purpose into question. Morrison prompts readers to wonder whether, rather than a literal reincarnation, perhaps, Beloved pays homage to the disremembered, the “Sixty Million and more” Black stories lost through slavery and cautions readers from erasing more today. While the author appears to centralize Beloved’s plot on Sethe and her reincarnated child, ultimately, Morrison intends to utilize Beloved as a metaphorical vessel for the trauma of slavery. In this manner, Morrison employs an palpable and emotional underpinning to the dehumanization experienced by the enslaved and formerly enslaved; this intimate style of storytelling remains paramount amidst the current desensitization towards those suffering disproportionately in the COVID-19 pandemic.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Through Morrison’s mystical style of writing, readers may often misinterpret the novel as one-dimensional, focused solely on Beloved and Sethe’s relationship. In this lense, the guilt and healing of Sethe dominates the narrative. Admittedly, Morrison’s imagery surrounding Beloved ties her directly to Sethe, specifically through the use of water. Illustrating Beloved, Morrison details, “A fully dressed woman walked out of the water” and soon after writes, “[Sethe] had to lift her skirts, and the water she voided was endless” (61). Within this deluge of water, Morrison symbolizes rebirth, and the reunion of a mother and her “new skinned” child. Through Sethe’s “endless” release, Beloved’s arrival emerges as a refuge for the heartache Sethe had suffered for over a decade. Morrison blatantly drills this connection in the mind of the reader as Beloved drops more hints for Denver and Sethe. Most poignantly, as the women thaw by the fireplace following their ice skating escapades, realization strikes Sethe: “Beloved was humming softly [...] ‘I made that song up,’ said Sethe. ‘Nobody knows that song but me and my children’” (207). In this scene, the repetition of first person: “I”, “me”, and “my children”, reinstates Sethe’s sense of self – being so accustomed to a status as her owner's property, Sethe had not demonstrated this autonomy prior. Thus, Beloved, as the reincarnation of her killed child, returns Sethe’s personhood and attempts to convince readers that Sethe’s single story defines the novel.\n",

      "However, to claim this novel circulates around Beloved as solely the reincarnated child of Sethe would be to dilute the multi-dimensional consequences of slavery; instead, Beloved represents the complex suffering resulting from centuries of racial degradation. Beloved transcends her role as the killed child as she reopens wounds in not only Sethe, but also Paul D and the surrounding Cincinnati society. In an attempt to drive a wedge between Paul D and Sethe, Beloved seduces the deeply traumatized former slave. Soulfully reawakened, Paul D “didn’t hear the whisper that the flakes of rust made either as they fell away from the seams of his tobacco tin” (137). Here, Beloved bypasses her status as the strange house guest; she allows Paul D to feel again, to escape the iron bit which had muted his heart as well. Moreover, the Cincinnati women crowding 124 Bluehouse’s yard see Beloved in “the shape of a pregnant woman” (308). Beloved’s pregnancy in this scene serves as a symbol of the rebirth and reconciliation of Sethe within the community. Instead of a heinous love child, Morrison uses themes of motherhood and desperation to catalyze the forgiveness of Sethe, transforming her from a ruthless murderer to a scarred but loving mother. Even beyond the handful of characters in Beloved, Morrison attaches Beloved to millions of slaves usurped from their homeland, as well as the violations each endured. In Beloved’s soliloquy, Morrison presents Beloved as timeless, as the limitless voice to those buried alone. She cries, “it is always now” (248).\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, Morrison’s metaphorical description of Beloved, coated in both ambiguous and intimate methods of narration, allows readers to understand the emotional burden of slavery. Rather than a flashy, murderous thriller, Morrison curates Beloved as a poetic dissection of trauma. Thus, the focus of the novel abandons concrete truths and chronology; even Beloved’s origins remain vague: “She didn’t mention one [a home]” (66). In this way, Morrison ushers readers away from the linear narrative of Beloved and towards the character’s feelings of pain, fear, and desolation. Specifically, Morrison concludes the novel by emphasizing the disremembering of Beloved’s story, claiming, “They never knew where or why she crouched, or whose underwater face she needed like that [...] sometimes the photograph [...] shifts, and something more familiar [...] moves there” (324). Instead of the superfluous details of 124 Bluehouse Lane, Morrison implores readers to notice the remnants of slavery’s atrocities which lurk beyond the novel. As such, the story-truth of Beloved offers an avenue for deeper empathy. \n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, Beloved surpasses the limits of her character’s role; her existence symbolizes the recurrent abuses and the aftermaths for enslaved populations. Yet, it would be ignorant to assume that racial mistreatment remains isolated to 1873. The threads of disproportionate treatment endure, especially in reference to the healthcare sector. In the COVID-19 pandemic, this healthcare disparity is baffling with the African-American population bearing a two times greater mortality rate than the national average. The lack of health equity stems from poor investment in healthcare and education infrastructure in the low-income communities which  house predominantly Black families. To what extent, though, does the common person revel in this reality? Moments. A useless notification, a scroll on a social media feed, a fleeting thought: the flood of news surrounding Black deaths and infection has desensitized an entire generation of mass media consumers, making it easier to forget the faces behind the headlines. Instead, Morrison’s novel advocates for the remembering, however painful, through Beloved. As Morrison weaves Sethe’s heartbreak, Paul D’s manhood, Stamp Paid’s guilt, and Denver’s isolation inside Beloved, she prompts readers to unpack these overlooked news stories and unveil the humanity behind them.\n",

Compared to the “come, nuclear bomb” of Morissey’s “Everyday is like Sunday,” Etta James’s “A Sunday Kind of Love,” is much more uplifting. But when James sings about her craving for a love that begins on Sunday, I cannot help but laugh. Sunday is a day for funeral processions, not the heart’s profession.

      "During a pandemic that has killed more than 267,000 U.S. citizens — a greater loss of American life than in World War I and the Vietnam and Korean Wars, combined — one might expect that virtually all citizens would recognize COVID’s threat and follow public health guidelines. That is not the case. Vivid examples of events that violated health guidelines serve as reminders of the widespread dismissive attitude toward science that infects American society. During the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally in September, an event that may be linked to as many as 200,000 COVID infections, tens of thousands packed into bars and crowded at concerts (Dave and coauthors; Shammas). The 45th president’s mask-free campaign rallies that led to over 30,000 infections and 700 deaths — shown by Stanford researchers — also stand out, among hundreds of similar events (Healy; Bernheim and coauthors). Although these events are unique for their large scope, their participants’ mindset and behavior are common. A study by the Pew Research Center in July found that 33 percent of U.S. adults did not consider the pandemic a major threat to the population’s health (Tyson). Some went so far as to issue death threats to health experts who urged them to trust scientific evidence and take the pandemic seriously (Smith). These baffling behaviors stem from anti-science, which refers to “attitudes and beliefs that are opposed to or reject science” (Merriam-Webster). As a product of the rapid spread of misinformation on social media and the failure of the American education system to train critical thinkers, the anti-science mindset will continue to threaten societal health unless immediately addressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The anti-science mindset leads many people to downplay COVID’s effects and thus reject public health measures, acts that first and foremost threaten their own wellbeing. Around the nation, there are countless sobering stories of anti-science proponents whom the virus bested. In July, a thirty-year-old man in San Antonio denounced the virus — which had already infected tens of thousands in the city — as a hoax, attended a party that he knew infected people were hosting, and fell ill (Torres). On his deathbed, he remorsefully admitted that he “made a mistake” before passing away; his misconception that the virus was a hoax led to his death. That a young adult like the San Antonio victim succumbed to the virus accentuates his story’s sobering lesson that anti-science beliefs have fatal consequences even for those who are not members of vulnerable populations. However, he is just one name in a long list of similar cases; for example, several patients of South Dakota emergency room nurse Jodi Doering have denied COVID’s very existence to their graves (Elliott). Especially worrisome, these deceased citizens were not alone in their rejection of COVID’s risks: In a study by the YouGov-Cambridge-Globalism Project, around 38 percent of surveyed Americans agreed that COVID’s death rate has been “deliberately and greatly exaggerated” (Henley). Even if the virus does not kill disbelievers, its potential long-term lung , heart, and brain damage to patients of all ages is severe enough to warrant vigilance (Galiatsatos; Cousin-Frankel; Budson). As shown by those who have already paid the ultimate price for anti-science beliefs, many of these Americans’ ignorance regarding the pandemic’s severity will no doubt result in death.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although some citizens possess immune systems capable of repelling the virus, their refusal to believe that the pandemic is real harms others. People tend to interact most with family or friends, so when anti-science supporters disregard COVID’s dangers, they especially risk the lives of the individuals who are close to them. Dallas native Tony Green, who downplayed the pandemic, had taken particular issue with scientific guidelines like social distancing. This mindset led him to host a family gathering at which attendees violated recommended health practices. Because of his negligence towards the virus, Green was one of fourteen family members to fall ill, two of whom died, including Green’s father-in-law — his self-described best friend (Saslow). As Green’s actions show, just one anti-science proponent can endanger over a dozen others whom they love, underscoring the necessity of minimizing the number of people who hold such harmful beliefs. The mass viral transmission at Green’s family gathering constitutes one of many “superspreader events,” defined by infectious disease specialist Lisa Maragakis as “gatherings of people where one infected person or more transmits the virus to many others” (Maragakis). Using mathematical models, MIT researchers have shown that superspreader events occur more often than the researchers expected (Trafton). Because their inattention to health guidelines exposes many others to infection, anti-science supporters are more likely than science-conscious citizens to be a part of superspreader events and are thus especially dangerous.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anti-science advocates’ mindset not only endangers themselves and others during the pandemic, but also negates mass vaccination, a critical path toward stopping the pandemic and saving lives. Vaccines’ proven efficacy against deadly infectious diseases, including measles, mumps, and hepatitis B, suggests that an effective COVID vaccine would facilitate a return to normalcy (Herper). However, doctors observe that those who are anti-science tend to be anti-vaccine, denying citizens even this beacon of hope (Posnett). According to a poll by Gallup in October, around 42 percent of Americans indicated that they would not agree to be vaccinated, and over a quarter of those negative responders cited anti-vaccine beliefs in general as the reason for their refusal (Reinhart). These high numbers, which are consistent with the findings of many surveys, indicate that millions of Americans may remain at-risk to the virus well into 2021, thus hindering authorities’ efforts to keep the pandemic under control. For the pandemic to truly die down, national health experts estimate that more than 70 percent of citizens must acquire immunity to the virus, either through vaccination or through exposure (Murphy). Otherwise, repeated outbreaks — seen already on multiple continents — may occur, forcing intensely affected regions to undergo multiple lockdowns, necessitating prolonged social distancing and mask-wearing for all, disrupting schools, damaging work, lowering productivity, and potentially sending a struggling economy to the brink of collapse.\n",
      "\n",
      "One might wonder, how do so many American citizens fall prey to the evident falsehoods of anti-science beliefs? On the surface level, their behavior seems nonsensical. Tony Green, after all, showed that even those who flout public health guidelines can change their mindset to adopt a rational standpoint. Upon deeper examination, however, American society contains several factors that spread anti-science beliefs. One such factor is the influence of social media, which has become increasingly popular: 246 million Americans used social media in 2019, a number projected to increase to 257 million by 2023 (Clement). Moreover, according to Pew, about one in five Americans surveyed consume most of their news from social media, and 35 percent more say that social media is one of their news sources (Infield). The trust that these citizens hold for social media content provides a perfect opportunity to spread misinformation, much of which contains COVID-related anti-science ideas. Notable figures like Donald Trump, who has 89 million Twitter followers and tweeted in October that COVID is “far less lethal” than the flu, can influence millions through their anti-science rhetoric (Hatmaker). Once misinformation appears on social media, it spreads rapidly; MIT researchers have found that people were 70 percent more likely to retweet false stories than true ones (Dizikes). When citizens read one incorrect social media post after another, their acceptance of misinformation no longer seems incomprehensible.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to the influence social media exerts on them, many Americans’ scientific illiteracy, aggravated by insufficient education, also contributes to their anti-science stances. A 2014 National Science Foundation study found that one in four surveyed Americans believe that the Sun revolves around the Earth, while over half of respondents did not know that humans evolved from animals (Grossman). Their ignorance of basic scientific facts stems from flawed or limited schooling. Less than half of respondents to a 2007 survey of American high school biology teachers said that the theory of supernatural divine creation should not be taught in the classroom (Nova Education. A 2019 Pew study found that Americans with higher levels of education were more likely than their less-educated counterparts to agree that the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine is beneficial (Hefferon). A similar trend appeared in a study that examined the percentage of Americans who saw truth in COVID-related conspiracy theories, in which a higher percentage of less-educated Americans tended to agree that the pandemic was planned (Schaeffer). As the studies show, increased education translates to decreased support for anti-science beliefs. The tendency among educated Americans to trust science, however, is not just because they possess abundant scientific knowledge. Schools do not teach students that Bill Gates did not create the pandemic (Reuters). Instead, researchers attribute scientific literacy also to critical thinking. When engaged in critical thinking, individuals analyze and evaluate information in order to reach an objective judgment (Vieira). Unfortunately, a 2019 MindEdge survey found that among respondents, 74 percent of millennials and 58 percent of baby boomers failed a critical thinking quiz that asked them to detect false information (MindEdge). The survey’s results help explain the prevalence of anti-science beliefs in America. Without scientific knowledge and critical thinking skills, citizens are at higher risk of believing anti-science propaganda and misinformation.\n",
      "\n",
      "    The lack of critical thinking skill is especially problematic since it exacerbates the unconscious tendency of anti-science proponents to stubbornly cling to their views. According to Stony Brook University political scientist Charles Taber, upon hearing arguments with which they disagree, people tend to “retrieve thoughts consistent with their previous beliefs” in a fight-or-flight response upon hearing arguments, leading them to instinctively support their own views (Mooney). NYU psychologist Jonathan Haidt compares anti-science supporters to lawyers who seek to win arguments through any means necessary instead of scientists who strive to discover truth (Haidt). Stanford University researchers illustrated this phenomenon in a 1979 study that showed participants made-up, similarly strong scientific papers about capital punishment. The researchers found that people classified the paper that aligned with their existing view as convincing and criticized the other paper, supporting the idea that people are devoted to their preconceived notions (Lord and coauthors). As the study suggests, anti-science proponents tend to agree with their own beliefs even when presented with opposing evidence and reasoning. Worse yet, anti-science advocates’ psychological conviction in their own beliefs exhibits itself in their denunciation of those whom they perceive to have betrayed their cause. After Tony Green wrote an op-ed to convince others of the pandemic’s severity, critics called him a murderer and told him to commit suicide (Modarressy-Tehrani). Thus, the anti-science movement is especially pervasive, as its supporters become more convinced over time that they are correct and attack dissenters like Tony Green in an attempt to dissuade them from embracing science.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prevalence of anti-science advocates necessitates a multifaceted treatment to cure the disease plaguing their minds. In the short term, fact-checking on social media may catch misinformation, increasing the chance that people will read factual content. Initial interventions have taken place: Facebook has removed several of Donald Trump’s posts that contained COVID-related incorrect information, but Twitter prefers to merely flag similar posts as misinformation (Wu). An approach that requires a longer period of time to show its efficacy involves gradually exposing people to moderate and nuanced opposing views, which builds trust over time. This tactic, as MIT and Yale researchers found in a 2020 study, effectively causes anti-immigration supporters to change their initial beliefs (Yang and coauthors). The researchers suggest that the logic of addressing anti-immigration fever also applies to other social issues, such as the anti-science disease. Therefore, citizens can use a similar approach when persuading others to accept science. To truly eradicate anti-science in the long term, however, our nation must train generation after generation of critical thinkers. An example of critical thinking’s effectiveness at debunking myth was demonstrated in 2014, when social psychologist Viren Swami conducted a study to assess performance on a conspiracy theory test. Swami found that those who underwent critical thinking training between the initial and final tests were less conspiratorial than those who did not (Moyer). Thus, increasing the number of Americans who think critically holds promise towards decreasing anti-science sentiment. Together, these interventions can catch misinformation in the short term and promote critical thinking in the long term, leading to a more informed, science-accepting society.\n",
      "\n",
      "The existence of anti-science believers in America compromises public health, as such people dismiss the fact that COVID can harm themselves and those with whom they interact. Although their actions seem especially egregious during a global pandemic, the proportion of vaccine-refusing citizens in 2019 shows that anti-science proponents are a constant thorn in the nation’s side. Despite causing the premature deaths of both themselves and innocent citizens through their actions, these Americans are not completely at fault. They are the product of a society that allows misinformation to infect them, a society that allows social media platforms to further aggravate their wounds by reinforcing their preconceived beliefs, a society that allows the existence of an education system that does not teach them to think critically, weigh opposing arguments, and accurately discern truth from falsehood. It is only through concerted efforts to disrupt the spread of misinformation on social media, engage in productive discourse with anti-science supporters, and stimulate critical thinking in future generations that America can cure itself of the anti-science disease.\n",

      "        Amongst the sticky hands and plump faces of elementary children, I grew up hating the color pink — the most universal symbol of femininity. Having a girl? Unleash the pink balloons, pop pink confetti, cut into pink cake. Even at such a young age, I saw the gender attached to the color but I also spotted the disfavors this color would bring me should I choose to don it. I viewed it as an infection, like a simple brushing up against the shade would turn me into “just another girl.” Little did I know, the color stained me at birth; it affixed a rosy target to my body, and sooner, rather than later, I would be shot at. While it is ultimately my choice to present myself as female and proclaim myself one in front of the world, there are many battles to be fought to free us women from the burden of the patriarchy. \n",
      "        One of these truths revealed itself to me under the sun. Such a wonderful thing, a brilliant ball of light that brings us warmth and enduring summer days. But even the sun cannot banish all of the shadows. I remember the sand the most, how it clung to my perspiring skin and in step beside me, my sister and our laughs. But our voices fell like the sun would leave behind that day — hours of uninterrupted bliss cast into the darkness in the span of a few minutes. There is an unsaid understanding in these moments — perhaps, if we are quiet, we will be invisible to him. Perhaps he will stop staring at us like we are devourable. We walked closer to the edge of the sidewalk, teetering beside the road to avoid him but his eyes poured over us greedily. The smile that he bore was so confident that no one would care about his perverse act, that no one in line beside him nor his family perched at his sides would even notice. And no one did. Our skin crawled with disgust and, oh, how we wished to be snakes that day; to slither out of our skin and leave behind the wounds that his eyes had seared into us. But we weren’t snakes, only girls, and so the only thing we could do was coat ourselves in laughter like it was a balm even though we were the joke. \n",
      "        There is an irrefutable right so many men feel towards women’s bodies that goes unchallenged by society. Because nobody even offered an admonishing glance towards our predator, he will continue his repugnant acts further endangering the well-being of any woman whom he chooses to perpetrate. This male entitlement is continuously depicted by Emma Cline’s The Girls. At one point in the book, an older Evie witnesses the adolescent Sasha being harassed by her boyfriend and his friend to bare her chest for them.  Evie recounts:\n",
      "Sasha’s face reddened.\n",
      "\"Do it, babe,\" Julian said, a harshness in his voice making me glance over. I caught Sasha’s eye — I told myself the look in her face was pleading.\n",
      "\"Come on, you guys,\" I said...\n",
      "“Sasha’s fine,” Julian said. He tucked a strand of her hair behind her ear — she smiled faintly and with effort. (Cline 262)\n",
      "Julain’s tone is quick to be defined as taking on a new harshness when his outlandish request is met by hesitation. The switch from playful and teasing to forceful proves how men believe that their power should go unchallenged. But Evie recognizes Sasha’s malaise and the hidden intention behind their demands: to humiliate her until she sinks back into docility. When Evie does reluctantly challenge Julian and Zav by saying “‘Come on, you guys,’” they are taken aback, offended even by her boldness. But ultimately, Sasha concedes. As Amanda Yates Garcia explains it in her memoir, Initiated: Memoir of a Witch, “The shadows of violence falls unbidden, and for many of us, just the threat of it, the lifetime of warnings to be careful, the accumulation of micro and macro assaults, are enough to keep us home, ‘safe’ under the protective aegis of the patriarchal father gods” (Garcia 2-3). It is the fear that keeps us at bay, that keeps us from returning the ogling stare of an older man with one filled with daggers. It is the fear that keeps us from reclaiming our bodies from “the patriarchal father gods” who put us on display but mock us all the while. We allow fear so much room in our lives that we limit ourselves from truly living. To confine oneself to only existing in the supposed safety of the light is to lose half of one’s life to the darkness. And then, the patriarchy wins.\n",
      "        It is a universal human desire to live and women are no exception. Whether it be in the light or the dark, we want to exist. Garcia’s own appetite for life is noted when she reveals:\n",
      "I was born delighted with the world, seeing the radiant, interdependent spirit of stone and leaf and animal-kind. But, as is also true of nearly every witch I know, my childhood was less about learning to recognize my agency within that web of interdependence than being forced to concede that the power and freedom I saw as my sacred birthright was not recognized by the rest of my species. (Garcia 17) \n",
      "Being a child allows one to view the world with such innocence but to be a young girl, one must learn early on to discern the sharp objects hiding in the shadows, the eyes ready to pierce us, the hands waiting to roam us. We are taught to hand over our power to the people in our lives who will make the decisions for us but rarely do we ever see this power returned to us. Because our lives offer us so little freedom, we will go to great lengths just for a scrap of it. This is what projects Evie into Russel’s cult but it is not the cult leader himself that pulls Evie into their effervescent world, rather the girls Russel surrounds himself with. While at the park, Evie claims, “I looked up because of the laughter, and kept looking because of the girls. I noticed their hair first, long and uncombed. Then their jewelry catching the sun… They were messing with an uneasy threshold, prettiness and ugliness at the same time, and a ripple of awareness followed them through the park” (Cline 3-4). The girls stand out from the rest of Evie’s monotonous life with their uncombed hair and cheap rings. They are proof of women who are really, truly living, not just taking up space but intimately inhabiting their realities. As beautiful as these girls are, they are regarded as foreign; their independence a strange threat to a society whose history is rooted in sticking all women in the same, insipid role. While it is the patriarchy’s will to keep us dormant, it is our duty to ourselves to recognize our rights.\n",
      "        In order to live a fulfilling, vibrant life, we must reclaim our bodies and our minds from those that wish to strip us bare. “The Yellow Wallpaper,” written by Charlotte Perkins Gilman, highlights that freedom is taken for oneself, not waited upon. After successfully clawing the paper from the wall, the woman paces crazily around the room. When her husband appears in the doorway, she exclaims, “‘I've got out at last,’ said I, ‘in spite of you and Jane. And I've pulled off most of the paper, so you can't put me back!’” (Gilman 10). While it seems the woman has cut ties to reality, she has actually cut ties to domesticity and the role her husband demanded she fill. The woman had spent weeks hidden within the walls of her house per her husband’s administration. She was forced into isolation until she finally took action. Her act of stripping the walls of their yellow cage was an act of reclaiming her mind and body and setting herself free from her husband’s authority. Garcia’s own act of cleansing herself of the patriarchy came in the form of a ceremony. Encircled by other women, she is encouraged to let go of her defenses and free herself from fear but her strength wavers. She explains, “Without my weapons I’d be defenseless. Regardless of my desire for it to be otherwise, it’s still a dangerous world. If I lay down my weapons, how will I protect myself?” (Garcia 327). But ultimately, her thirst for freedom outweighs her reservations because Garcia understands that “the problem with weapons is as much as we turn them against the world, we turn them against ourselves” (Garcia 327). Being the underdog for so long, no one understands more than women that it is better to leave this world on our own terms than live under the patriarchy. Much like the women before us, the ones that carved the path up to where we are today with their pain and fury, we must stake a claim on ourselves before letting anyone place limits upon us. \n",
      "        To be a girl in this world is to have an unabated yearning to inhabit life and witness all that it can offer without fear. Strength to do this is not learned, it is recognized. It was always there but the decision comes down to: Are we ready to acknowledge it? I do not wish to be confined. I will take every fragment of freedom that I can and I will exert my power over my own life. Those who try to tame me will be bitten because to be a docile creature is to live on a leash and die with a collar. I hereby claim myself as my own because I belong to no one else. Cline, Garcia, and Gilman wrote their stories to expose the prowess we all possess. And so, to the men who wish to ogle and touch without permission: beware.

      "No More Manless Eden: The Notable Decline of Female Involvement in Hollywood\n",
      "\n",
      "This paper is an examination of the notable decline of female involvement in the American film industry, its causes, and the context of the decline from filmmaking’s origination through the present. The first film screening in America took place in April 1896 at a New York City music hall.  About twenty years later, in 1920, the book “Careers for Women” was published by Catherine Filene. It called itself “a complete and authoritative guide to the one hundred and sixty occupations open to women.” Among the jobs listed in the book was directing. The book described directing as “an open field for hardy and determined women.” Women were considered “superior” for the field because of their “...emotional and imaginative faculties.” Filene predicted that in the future, women would “find no finer calling” than directing.\n",
      " \n",
      "From 1915 to 1925, women directed more than 50 percent of all of the silent films copyrighted in America. Today, the story is vastly different. From 2008-2018,  women directed only 4.6 percent of all American films produced. The male director that had worked the most was Tyler Perry, who released 17 films during those years, and the top performing female was Anne Fletcher, with just 4 films. The highest- earning director in Hollywood from 1908 to 1918 was a woman; Lois Weber, who made approximately 160,000 dollars a year, or about 2 million dollars in today’s money. Today, all of the top 10 highest earning directors in Hollywood are male, George Lucas earning the most at nearly 110 million dollars a year.  The Directors Guild of America was started in 1936 and serves Hollywood by representing the interests of film and television directors across America. At its inception, the guild had about 800 members, and over sixty percent of these were female.  Today, of its more than 15,000 members, only 14 percent are female directors. This paper will discuss the film industry’s leap from a small collection of independent artists to the booming, money-filled industry it is today, and most notably, the significant decline in female involvement in the American filmmaking community. \n",

      "Film is a somewhat modern art form. When it was first becoming utilized in the late 1890’s and  early 1900s, it was far from being considered an industry. Films at this time were usually no more than 10 minutes on average, and were shown collectively at five-cent theaters known as Nickelodeons. Film, although still silent at the time,  had no rules, and the boundaries were being pushed further every day. Filmmakers were called an “interesting assortment of eccentric creators”, and the greater half of these artists were women.  In her book “Without Lying Down”, Cari Beauchamp writes that “The most important reason to understand why there was this incredible group of women working in the movies was because filmmaking was not taken seriously as a business.” This began to change in 1927,  when the world’s first movie with dialogue, “The Jazz Singer” was released.  With this, the world saw the introduction of “movie palaces”,  lavish theaters designed specifically for viewing feature films, and film began to stake its place as an American icon. Most importantly, Filmmaking and directing was starting to be seen as a vehicle for profit instead of simply a hobby.\n",
      "\n",
      " In 1920, there were 100 filmmaking companies in the USA, but as production value for movies increased, the companies that were unable to merge together went out of business, and by 1930, there were only 7 bigger companies making Hollywood’s films. During the Great Depression, cinema was the 10th most profitable industry in the United States. In France, it was the fastest growing business enterprise, even more money coming from films than paper and electricity.  From a creative and somewhat oddball collective of independent artists rose a behemoth industry which paid incredibly well, and one that could offer a career to anyone who wanted to make money. Films in the early days of cinema had crews of about 30 people. Nowadays, however,  the average crew size is far more: anywhere from 600 to 1,000 people working on big-budget movies. As the film industry continued to grow, the original matriarchs of the industry were pushed out by people, mostly men, who intended to commercialize films and  provide the public with movies in a high quantity in order to earn as much money as possible. In society, women were not simply not being seen as potential billionaires in the way that men were. Even with consistent industrial growth from the  1920’s to present day, there has been little social adaptation in Hollywood. The Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film conducted research in 2018 which found that, in 1999, 9 percent of American Senators were female, and only 4 percent of directors were female. They found that in 2018, the American senate had not only grown but adapted, and by then, women made up 25 percent of it. Hollywood, however, had not changed. In 2018, only 4 percent of directors are female. These statistics side by side give valuable insight into how little Hollywood has changed over the course of almost two decades in comparison to a political institution which has worked in roughly the same way ever since it was created, long before filmmaking was even considered as a career. The film industry grew exponentially fast, and because it was not able to keep up with itself in ensuring equal opportunities and representation for women, it proves to be stuck in a cycle of stark under-representation of females. \n",
      "\n",
      "Today, certain trends are clear when examining the lack of female representation in Hollywood. One is the preconceived notion that women are best at writing “quirky” and “homespun” films.  Journalist Mark Harris stated that “Producers take a good small movie by a guy as a sign he's ready to step up; by a woman, it's a sign that she's found her niche.” Women are also considered to be less suited to being in charge of action and adventure movies, the two most popular film genres in America. For instance, the multibillion dollar film studio, Marvel (A subset of Disney), has made 23 movies over the course of 11 years, the first being Iron Man in 2008, which made 585.2 billion dollars at the American box office, and the most recent being Avengers: Endgame, earning roughly 2.9 billion dollars in 2019. Of these films, none have had female directors or writers. Paramount Pictures, the film distributor credited with the How to Train Your Dragon, Shrek, and Kung Fu Panda franchises, among others, hired no female directors from 2007 to 2018, less than any other film company. Because there is already such an obvious domination in the film industry by men, it is much harder for a woman to enter a job in Hollywood on even ground.  Amy Adrion’s documentary “Half the Picture” seeks to call out the sexism and female erasure in today’s filmmaking world. Adrion interviewed 52 high-profile female directors, including Ava DuVernay (Selma), Sam Taylor-Johnson (Fifty Shades of Grey), and Mary Harron (American Psycho).  Several of the women interviewed recalled producers trying to create a film that was “more emotional than exciting” when searching for female directors. These stigmas alone can influence many potential filmmakers when looking for a job, and can therefore contribute to the lack of female representation as a whole. \n",
      "\n",
      "Interestingly, stigmas such as those aforementioned have been around and affecting women since the 1400’s in Elizabethan England. In Shakespeare’s performances, men were the only people allowed to be actors. This was because acting was considered a “true profession” that was not suitable for women. Men were thought to be better at performing emotional roles, and were considered “altogether more convincing” in female roles which required emotional depth. Many historians believe that men portraying females allowed their characters to be taken more seriously and admired more by the audience than if played by an actual woman. It is difficult to tell if these choices impact the way the performance industry discriminates against women today, but the Shakespeare’s plays are undoubtedly a prime example of the deep- rooted stigmas against women’s general ability to do as well, if not better, than men in artistic pursuits. One may argue that the filmmaking industry has become a business pursuit as opposed to an artistic one. This history also shows how once a line of work is deemed a career or “true profession”, women tend to be pushed out in favor of men, the supposed “breadwinners” of their society. Business roles, certainly, are stereotypically considered to be roles taken on by men. Even so, after looking at the history of the film industry, it is clear that the shift from art form to industry could have been far more harmonious and prevented the loss of such creative spirit, although it is not clear if that would have given women more of a grasp on their roles budding industry, and that sort of shift would prove to  be much more complicated when applied to the heavily capitalist and money-minded society that Hollywood grew out of. \n",
      "\n",
      "One seemingly obvious contributor to the lack of women in the film industry is the sometimes blatant sexism by an excess of men in higher positions, likely caused by the expansion of the industry after 1927. Cinema was coined as a “manless Eden” by the Boston Post in 1923. At that time, about 87 percent of the women in directing roles had been, or would be, actresses at some point in their career.  This created a trend of films written by and for women. Lois Weber broke barriers by writing films that spoke on birth control and rape, among other taboo subjects, even showing a breastfeeding woman in one of her works. In a 1927 report, it was found that women made up 83 percent of all moviegoers. Mary Pickford, an actor-turned-screenwriter in the 1910’s said she would “never write a role [she] wouldn’t be proud to take up [her]self”. Today, in the large industry, there is a much larger divide between those writing and directing movies and the actors themselves,  most notably between male directors and the actresses in their films. Actress Jennifer Lawrence, on an interview with ELLE magazine in 2017, said she was told at an audition that she would have to lose 15 pounds in two weeks if she wanted the part, and was told about a different actress before her who had been fired for not losing the weight fast enough. Lawrence recalled feeling “like more of a prop than a person” in that moment, and the story speaks to the lack of personal compassion held by the film industry in today’s world. \n",
      "It is also important to recognize the more than 800 women in Hollywood who have come forward in recent years as part of the “#MeToo” movement. This movement, which began in October 2017 with actress Ashley Judd’s  accusation of producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault. Her story gave many other women the courage to speak up about their own experiences of sexual assault while working in the film industry, and how the dynamic of their work encouraged silence in order to keep the peace and sometimes, their jobs. The “#MeToo” movement showed that sexism is still alive and well in the film industry, despite many believing it to be a thing of the past. However, an upside of the movement is that of the 201 men who lost directing, producing, or acting jobs after sexual assault charges, 54 of the 124 replacement positions have gone to women.  The scarcity of women in the film industry is impacted by the fact that Hollywood has become infamous as a place where women are not treated well, making it harder for them to reach success in their art. The extreme excess of power given to those in important positions, often men, allow the abuse to go on somewhat unchecked. \n",
      "\n",
      "At its beginning, the film industry was not a place of any kind of sex-based prejudice. Women used the art form as a place to display frustrations, statements, and stories for a fairly small audience to see. Ultimately, the collective of artists were not ready for the swift industrialization of their work when filmmaking became a seriously profitable and respectable career. The industry grew out of control, and has become quite different from what it was in the 1900s. Films that were once only ever intimate productions made by 30 or less people have become far less personal. As a result, certain famous directors, actors, and screenwriters are kept at the top of the hypothetical filmmaker’s hierarchy, making it far more difficult for newer, smaller creatives to find a spot in Hollywood success. With time, stigmas are established, further preventing women from gaining proper footholds in the most profitable and high-impact Hollywood productions.  It is also important to look at the overall attitudes of the past and current filmmaking communities comparatively. Originally, cinema was all about testing boundaries. It was difficult to institute any kind of discrimination or preconceived notions because the thought of what filmmaking was or could be was so unknown. Film was an art and a form of expression, not a venture of profit. Today, many film executives and higher-ups have movies down to a system. They know how to market, cast, and produce their films in order to draw in as many patrons as possible. Hollywood is full of familiar faces, newcomers being few and far between. Many have noticed the shift, and are working to bring light to the drastic lack of female representation in mainstream movies, but progress is slow going. After looking at the film industry’s history, the reasons for female underrepresentation become clearer, and valuable insight is found on the gender issue faced by Hollywood today.\n",

      "“Looking Through the Window:”\n",
      "Narrative Form and the Act of Reading as Voyeurism in Wuthering Heights\n",
      "       It would be an understatement to say there are a lot of windows in Emily Bronte’s Wuthering Heights. To be more specific, there are 74 separate mentions of windows throughout the novel, and that count does not even include synonyms like “lattice” or “casement.” Windows appear when Mr. Lockwood first appraises the outside of Wuthering Heights, and windows appear when, years later, he returns to find a decaying kirk and the graves of Heathcliff, Catherine, and Edgar. Given their ubiquity in the book, windows are perhaps the most noticeable and oft-interpreted symbol in Bronte’s novel, clearly representing the liminal space between the opposing sides of a dichotomy. Wuthering Heights is, essentially, a meditation on the nature of dichotomies -- Gothic and Victorian, past and present, natural and supernatural, inside and outside, life and death, adult and child, emotion and rationality -- so it is only natural for it to use windows, which are a liminal, transparent barrier between two extremes, as one of its central symbols.  However, Bronte’s use of windows extends far beyond this fairly obvious symbol meant to emphasize the dichotomies the novel is so obsessed with -- in fact, windows can also be read as the blueprint for the very form of the novel itself. Bronte’s usage of windows both to introduce abnormality and non-linearity into the novel (in terms of form and content) and to create the framework for that abnormal, non-linear structure ends up implicating the reader in the novel’s voyeurism, thus making a larger comment on the action of reading and the existence of novels as a whole.\n",
      "     To paraphrase Robert Creeley, form is an extension of content. We see this first at the very beginning of the novel, when Catherine’s ghost reaches through the window and grabs Lockwood’s hand. Lockwood is understandably shocked and afraid, and because “terror made [him] cruel,” he “pulled [the creature’s] wrist on to the broken pane, and rubbed it to and fro till the blood ran down and soaked the bed clothes.” (32) Catherine’s appearance is shocking not only to Lockwood, but the reader as well -- as her spectral form bursts through the window and latches onto Lockwood, this sudden and violent appearance of a very literal “ghost from the past” bursts through the page and latches onto the narrative. Both Lockwood and the reader are taken entirely by surprise, as the former was simply expecting a good night’s sleep and the latter simply to watch that good night’s sleep. It is a disruption both within the world of Wuthering Heights and outside of it, in a broader metatextual sense. Then, after Lockwood tells Heathcliff about his interaction with this otherworldly “Catherine Linton,” the latter is overcome by an intense and feverish “gush of grief” -- he gets onto the bed to be in reach of the window, “wrenche[s] open the lattice, bursting, as he pull[s] at it, into an uncontrollable passion of tears.” (36) Lockwood is taken aback by this “excess of violent emotion” from a man who so far has been stoic, one-dimensional, aloof, even cruel. (35) The wealth of sudden powerful feelings suggests to the reader that Catherine’s supernatural appearance pushes Heathcliff headfirst into his own past, something he likely represses and avoids -- Catherine’s spectral hand through the window, however, leaves him no choice but to confront it. This holds true for Lockwood as well; he’s so intrigued by the shocking display he just witnessed that he begs Nelly to tell him his neighbors’ history, insisting he “shall not rest if [he] go[es] to bed” otherwise. (44) Evidently, both Heathcliff and Lockwood are driven to distraction -- if not distress -- by Cathy’s paranormal disruption, and are forced in one way or another to face the past, even though that means turning away from the present. That same observation can be applied to the narrative and form of the novel itself, as this narrative disruption -- this instance of the past breaking through to the present, the dead breaking through to those alive, the supernatural breaking through to the natural, a hand breaking through a glass window -- causes the novel to almost immediately shift to the past, forcing the reader to learn about and live through it, rather than continue living in the novel’s present. This narrative intervention forces the reader to encounter the past in the same way Cathy’s supernatural intervention forces Heathcliff and Lockwood to, form once again mimicking content.\n",
      "    In shattering the novel’s focus on the present, the shove of Catherine’s phantom hand through the window ends up being the driving force behind the unique narrative structure that persists for the rest of the novel. With a few exceptions, the story from here on is Nelly’s, albeit filtered through Lockwood’s perspective. If Nelly relays an anecdote Heathcliff once told her, the reader must look through Lockwood’s perspective into Nelly’s perspective into her own past into Heathcliff’s perspective. As the novel progresses, the story we are reading gets filtered through these different lenses, these different frames -- and arguably -- these different windows. Although the novel is usually described as featuring a “frame narrative,” it might be more accurate to refer to it as a “window narrative” instead -- there is nothing stopping those outside a frame from reaching inside, whereas with a window, there’s a solid pane of glass, thus allowing one to peer in and maybe even press a cheek against the surface while making it impossible (as long as it is locked) to actually enter. The reader of a novel is incapable of stepping inside of it, of reaching a hand into the frame and adjusting the picture on the other side, so wouldn’t it be more accurate to refer to this narrative structure as a series of windows instead? We, as readers, must peer through the set of windows in front of us (the page, Lockwood’s perspective, Nelly’s perspective) in order to glean the truth of the story as best as we can. Therefore, in a particularly cosmically satisfying paradox, this new narrative structure of frames and filters and lenses that will define the rest of the novel, this “window narrative,” is only made necessary -- only made possible -- by the breaking of a window.\n",
      "     Bronte’s use of this “window narrative” is ingenious, particularly when looking at it from the angle of form being an extension of content -- just as the characters of the novel spend their lives looking through windows they’ll never actually be able to open, we as readers have to look through these windows that allow us to observe but never participate. While their windows divide (either through literal or figurative means) past from present, Wuthering Heights from Thrushcross Grange, Gothic society from Victorian, life from death, natural from supernatural, and themselves from a world intent on limiting them, our windows separate reality from fiction, perception from truth, point-of-view from point-of-view, frame from frame, and ourselves and our world from them and theirs. We are able to uniquely sympathize with the characters because in order to even read the novel, we are forced to engage with their world in the same way that they are -- the only way to read the novel is through the windows, so if we want to read it, we must experience their world as they do. We cannot leave our world and enter the novel any more than most of them are able to break free of their own dichotomies and cross the space between the polar opposites they confront.\n",
      "     As previously discussed, windows in the novel symbolically represent both the barriers and the liminal spaces between the black-and-white structural, societal, and natural dichotomies that Wuthering Heights so relishes.  The frequent (and often longing) gazes characters cast towards those all-important glass panes represent their desires for whatever unattainable something -- be that a world, person, lifestyle --  lies on the other side of the window. Often, especially in this novel, a window symbolizes a tempting impossibility, an impossible temptation of sorts -- but sometimes it doesn’t. Sometimes it is boredom that flicks a glance or two towards a window or some perceived flurry of movement outside; sometimes it is awe that makes one look and sometimes it’s disdainful, mocking derision; sometimes it might even be something as simple as a desire for entertainment. Regardless: a window is peered into, another world lies on the other side of the glass, and despite how many finger smudges are left against the surface, that world will always be out of reach -- it is yours to watch, but not to touch. Doesn’t that sound an awful lot like the act of reading novels? We sit there and observe these worlds we know aren’t and will never be ours, forming opinions and passing judgments on people we’ll never know, events that will never affect us, places we’ll never see. \n",
      "    The meaning behind the windows of Wuthering Heights swoops into metafictional commentary at this point, as Bronte seems to implicate the reader in the novel’s voyeurism. This interpretation of the symbolism of windows puts us, the readers, in essentially the same position as young Heathcliff and Catherine staring down into the Linton’s living room, uninvited, unwanted, and (for them, at least at first) unnoticed. Heathcliff mocks the Linton children for their greed and entitlement, their gaudy opulence and riches -- “I’d not exchange, for a thousand lives, my condition here for Edgar Linton's at Thrushcross Grange,” Heathcliff sneers to Nelly, “not if I might have the privilege of flinging Joseph off the highest gable, and painting the housefront with Hindley's blood!” He uses this view of the Lintons to feel good about himself, laughing “outright at the petted things” and making himself feel bigger, stronger, better by comparing himself to them. Catherine laughs along, all the while quietly wishing their world of “crimson-covered chairs and tables” and “ceilings bordered by gold” was her own -- she seems to be awed and almost comforted by its beauty, incredibly envious of it all (leading her to feel worse about herself in direct contrast from Heathcliff), and still somewhat repulsed by this extravagant display of excess and selfishness. This passage is a key one, a metatextual moment that thematizes the very act of reading in all its complexity, distilling it down to one small truth: we are them. We are them not only because we both look through windows, but because of the human reactions and inferences we have to what we see, the laughter and yearning, the anger and attachment. Maybe one reader is a Heathcliff, scoffing at a character’s hissyfits and using it to fuel their own ego. Maybe another is a Catherine, desperately wanting to escape from their world and finding an unsettling mix of comfort and envy in projecting onto this fictional one. It’s for these reasons that our watching through windows transforms from mere observance to a form of voyeurism -- we aren’t indifferently glancing out cafe windows, but delving deep into the framework of a world we will never touch, into the personal lives of characters that will never be made aware of our presence. Reading is done with selfish intent, and seeing Heathcliff and Cathy spy on the Lintons through their window for no reason other than their own pleasure, derision, awe, or entertainment makes the reader painfully aware of the similarities that can be drawn between the two of them and the one flipping the page. We are implicated in the characters’ act of voyeurism because the fact that we are watching it immediately draws attention to our own. Bronte uses this moment in the plot (in conjunction with the window’s symbolism of being porous enough to be tempting, impenetrable enough to be nearly impossible) to comment on not only Wuthering Heights, but on the novel as a form and reading literature as an activity.\n",
      "    Windows clearly play a major role in Wuthering Heights because they so neatly symbolize the novel’s preoccupation with dichotomies and binary opposites, but Bronte’s fascination with windows goes even further than that -- she turns windows into a major structural device in the novel and uses them as the vehicle for metafictional commentary on not only the very novel we’re reading but on the act of reading itself. Bronte views reading fiction as equivalent to peering through transparent glass into another world in the hopes of finding entertainment, humor, inspiration, comfort, escape, even identity waiting on the other side. But regardless of how relentlessly we tap on the windowpane of the page or rattle the lattices of words, that world, that other space, will always be separate from us. By using windows as a symbol to remind readers of this reality and of our status as voyeurs rather than citizens, Bronte creates an almost implicit bond between the novel’s characters and the reader, as neither can forget the impermeability of the boundaries that make up our respective worlds.  \n",

      "     1937, in Moscow province. \n",
      "     At the conclusion of a conference of the Soviet Union’s Communist Party, the audience erupted into thunderous applause. A blurred roar, the frenzied claps (each slap, jolts, shocks, turning palms red) merging into a single heavy drone, shouts of “Long live our beloved Comrade!” and “Glory to the revolution!” scattered throughout, the occasional lyric of The Internationale. Lunging to their feet, these district leaders were honouring Joseph Stalin, an unrelenting dictator estimated to have executed a million political prisoners during the Great Terror, on top of the 7 million people who died in his policy-created famines, and the millions more who died in harsh sentences in Gulag labour camps.\n",
      "     All eagerly applauded, practically racing to see who leapt to their feet first, who clapped the loudest, the fastest—even when Stalin walked off of the stage, they were still clapping. It must’ve been like rain, like in a storm—each drop indistinguishable in the thick sheets of water, slamming down. Like white noise—staticky mixtures of frequencies, vibrations of applause, drowning out all individual sounds, a murmur defined by its sameness.\n",
      "     But the question arose: Who would be the first person to stop applauding Stalin? Who would dare?\n",
      "     No one. And so, the clapping went on. And on.\n",
      "     Nobel-prize winner Alexander Solzhenitsyn recounted this bizarre experience: \n",
      "     “The applause went on—six, seven, eight minutes! They were done for! Their goose was cooked! They couldn’t stop now till they collapsed with heart attacks! …Nine minutes! Ten!…Insanity! To the last man! With make-believe enthusiasm on their faces, looking at each other with faint hope, the district leaders were just going to go on and on applauding till they fell where they stood, till they were carried out of the hall on stretchers.”\n",
      "     I wonder if it was comforting, to clap among hundreds, enveloped in humming, swaddled between warm bodies, shush, shush filling their ears, floating in steady volume, as their hands bled.\n",
      "\n",
      "Night.\n",
      "     Swedish researchers at Uppsala University, led by Dr Richard Mann, investigated how applause starts and stops in an audience by filming the response of groups of university students to an oral presentation. And contrary to the belief that the better the show, the longer the clapping, these scientists found that applause spreads more as a disease—a contagion—than as feedback. Richard Mann said in an interview with NPR, “Our principal finding was that clapping is indeed socially driven, so people feel the social pressure to begin clapping if others in the crowd are already clapping, and likewise to stop clapping if others have stopped.” \n",
      "     This research is one of many recent works that have begun to quantify social contagion—the spread of behaviour from one crowd participant to another. It’s found in animals, too—ant colonies, fish schools, bees—this ‘hive mind’ or ‘swarm intelligence’ creates a network, a single body, a one. Why? The swarm is smarter than the individual. Murmations—flocks of starlings (small birds, glossy, iridescent, black)—fly safer, find more feeding sites, escape predators faster, survive better. \n",
      "     They’re incredible, these murmurations. Senior scientist at the Peregrine fund Grainger Hunt described one: “A dazzling cloud, swirling, pulsating, drawing together to the thinnest of waists, then wildly twisting in pulses of enlargement and diminution, a fluid choreography of funnels, ribbons, and hourglasses, spills and mixing, ever in motion. Dense in one moment, diffuse in the next.” This great black cloud, its morphing fluidity, synchronous, turning, trusting, hypnotizing, “on the edge” phenomenon, ready to shapeshift (like lightning, like shadows), expanding and contracting, out and in, a pulse. Ba-dum, ba-dum—steady, reliable. Come weak starling and hide in the storm, away from the risk, the falcons, the peregrines.\n",
      "     A company has begun to apply this swarm intelligence for humanity’s own pretzeled form of survival. Unanimous AI connected twenty horse enthusiasts online, and, for the 143rd Kentucky Derby, they successfully predicted the top four horses of the race—in exact order. A $20 superfecta bet would have returned $11,000. What’s amazing is that, out of the twenty, no individual predicted all of the horses correctly—the swarm amplifies intelligence, capable of what is impossible alone. From forecasting movie box-office to anticipating the price of bitcoin, the great black cloud consistently outperforms the individual.\n",

      "     One Night Werewolf is a fifteen-minute secret-identity game, taking place in three stages: Night, Day, and Dusk. Before the game, the players receive their roles on small cardboard cards—Seer, Robber, Insomniac, and so on. Two of them are werewolves. At Night, all players close their eyes and take turns opening their eyes to do their roles in secret, with the werewolves opening their eyes to identify each other. During the Day, the Village tries to figure out who the Werewolves among them are, and the Werewolves try to deceive them. They vote to lynch at Dusk, the Village winning if they lynch a Werewolf, and the Werewolves winning if a Villager is lynched instead.\n",
      "     My friends and I played one night before dinner, piling worn bean bags around a scratched-up coffee table and turning on a dying floor lamp that made our faces soft and warm, stocking the room with crisps and red plastic cups and sticky chicken wings, the eight of us giggling as we looked at our roles and then closed our eyes for the first Night.\n",
      "     Mary claims Robber when we wake up in the Day, saying that she stole Alex’s card, who was Regular Villager. Avery says she’s Seer and saw that Lynea was a Werewolf.  Alex admits that he was also a Werewolf, so if Mary stole his card then she’s the Werewolf instead. The two Werewolves, caught, jump back into their bean bags, huddling against each other and laughing as they wave around their chicken wings and wail along to Don Mclean: “This’ll be the die that I’ll die, this’ll be the day that I’ll die.”    \n",
      "     Dusk: 3, 2, 1, the rest of us throw out our fingers at them with gusto and they howl.\n",
      "     Next game, Night. We close our eyes, focusing on the drone of the fan, trying to avoid hearing the shuffles of the Robber switching his card, the Seer leaning in to spy someone else’s, the Werewolves smirking at each other as their eyes meet.\n",
      "     Day. We open our eyes, looking at each other sheepishly, almost sleepily, exaggeratedly stretching. Seb puts his cup down and claims Seer, declares that Mary is a werewolf. Mary yelps, but Lynea nods her head, “yeah, she’s usually the one to talk first every round.”’\n",

      "     “I’m telling the truth!”\n",
      "     “You’re a terrible liar, Mary,” Seb grins, reaching for a chicken wing, and the rest of us murmur in agreement.\n",
      "     Mary continues protesting, and the seven of us respond in playful pity, giving each other knowing looks. One minute of Day left, and we shuffle around to cluster together opposite to Mary, chuckling together as Mary whines, “Guys, I’m a villager, I’m a villager...” The lamp stood behind us, casting long shadows over her. “I’m a villager!” but we don’t hear her over our laughter, over the drone of the fan, “I’m a villager, I’m a villager…”\n",
      "     Dusk. Mary flips over her card, revealing a pot-bellied cartoon leaning on a pitchfork, snoozing under ‘Regular Villager’. We groan while Seb and Lynea whoop, fist-bumping each other, baring their teeth as they grin.\n",

The crowd was hot and tired, but they kept on going, stronger together. “Long live the united, mighty Soviet Union!” At last, the director of the paper factory sat down, and the white noise shattered.

      "On December 17th, 2010, Mohammed Bouazazi set himself aflame on the streets of Sidi Bouzid, Tunisia. Little did he know that his individual protest would be the catalyst for widespread revolution across the Middle East. How his protest was able to generate such change, and why 2010 was the right time for his protest, is a key question for understanding to the Arab Spring. Tunisia was the first country to revolt, and less than a month after Bouazazi, President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali had stepped down from power. Tunisia’s initial successful transition from authoritarian to more democratic rule stemmed from several unique features, including its history of cultural dissent, the existence of civil organizations, and the relative weakness of the military. The main vulnerabilities that led to protests in Tunisia were a lack of economic opportunity, and to a lesser degree, “de-democratization” and political discontent. In achieving lasting change in government, Tunisia proved an anomaly among Arab states, and aspects of its national culture pre-disposed the country for successful political change. However, a major root of turmoil- low economic opportunity- has yet to be fully resolved and remains a persistent vulnerability that threatens ongoing political reform.\n",
      "One major force of destabilization at the root of Tunisia’s revolution was the lack of economic opportunities. President Ben Ali’s neoliberal economic policies caused Tunisia’s GDP to grow before 2010, but the general population did not benefit. Crony capitalism diverted benefits to President Ben Ali’s family and friends. In addition, Tunisia suffered from extremely high rates of unemployment in young and highly educated population, making “popular uprising inevitable, if not long overdue.” (Prashad 12) Rampant corruption, and a disparity of economic development across regions, widened wealth inequality and caused high poverty rates. In 2011, 73% of the population described the economic situation as “somewhat bad” or “very bad.” (Figure 1) The unemployment rate for those with a higher level education was at 29.2%, while the unemployment for university graduates was around 40% (Pew). An increasingly globalized labor market and a lack of opportunity in public sector left an entire generation in “severe frustration, as young men are unable to earn enough to get married, find a place to live, raise a family, and young educated women stay at home waiting to get married. This has led to a whole generation in waiting: waiting for better jobs, for housing, and waiting to get married and raise a family.” (Ghanem) The combination of an educated population and lack of economic opportunity was especially volatile. “Good education failed to translate into job prospects for many Tunisians. Problems of mass unemployment…cast a shadow” over Tunisia’s authoritarian rule. (Masri 280) This frustration with lack of economic opportunity proved a fundamental driver of change, as 63% of Tunisians cited the weak economy as their reason for revolting against President Ben Ali (IRI). In addition, many Tunisians cited corruption as their reason for revolution. In Tunisia, corruption and a failed political process inhibited economic success, as political ties to businesses stymied widespread distribution of wealth. Nearly 80% of Tunisians viewed economic problems, and not political reform, as the justification for revolution. Furthermore, in a poll conducted in 2011, 59% of the population preferred a strong economy while only 40% preferred a good democracy, as the best possible outcome of the revolution (Figure 3). Economic grievances and hope for new opportunities were clearly at the heart of Tunisia’s revolution.\n",
      "Economic weaknesses also effected Ben Ali’s political strength. Part of an authoritarian social contract is the promise of an economic safety net in exchange for political support. Yet a majority of Tunisians were disappointed with their economic stability, and thus arose a “fundamental crisis” within this social contract and support of the regime declined. Additionally, Ben Ali’s government consistently undermined its legal strength by passing “de-democratizing” rule of law legislation- generating laws that disenfranchised the public. Ali implemented two major pieces of legislation (a 1992 civil society organization law and 2002 constitutional revision) that “eviscerated his opposition and prevented independent civil society activity.” (Ghanem) In the short term, Ali eroded governmental institutions, but in the long term, as he dismantled “the legitimacy of Tunisian institutions and the substantive meaning of the rule of law... his de-democratization created a fundamental rejection of the political system in its entirety.” (Rand 46) As a result of this, citizens were disillusioned with the ability of any autocrat to implement political change, and thus only “only radical, discontinuous change and a complete change of leadership” would be able to execute true reform in Tunisia (Rand 47).\n",
      "When the Arab Spring did arrive in Tunisia, several factors fostered democratic change. Tunisia’s history of cultural dissent, strong civil institutions, and the separation of the military from political rule, allowed the revolution to be initially successful. The history of cultural dissent and critique in Tunisia can be traced back to criticism of French colonialism in the 1930s. Individuals and organizations, including “journalists, novelists, playwrights, filmmakers, intellectuals, lawyers, high school teachers…soccer players, and singers,” contribute to dissent in Tunisia, creating a society so entrenched in sociopolitical critique that one “cannot miss the latent or indirect critique it carried and disseminated.” (GIGA) The Tunisian revolution thus “attested to the longevity of the tradition of political dissent” in Tunisia (GIGA). Additionally, Tunisia had a tradition of strong civil institutions. By 2009, there was over 9000 such groups, including labor unions, women’s organizations, and cultural and economic developmental organizations. Therefore, “the institutional structures for the development of a free civil society were established by the Ancien Régime and do not need to be established anew.” (Beck) Lastly, Ben Ali and Habib Bourguiba both kept the military removed from political decisions. Because of its separation from politics, the “military had little reason to fight for the regime after the outbreak of protests…[and did] not hinder democratization” (Beck) This lack of a “strong, large, political army proved Tunisia’s greatest strength.” (Masri 114) Thus, the revolution of 2011, driven by economic dissatisfaction and resentment of the authoritarian state, was initially successful, and Tunisia appeared as prepared as any to effectively institute change.\n",
      "Economic grievances and political disillusionment were the heart of substantive claims against the Ben Ali government, and loomed as critical issues for the successful post-Arab Spring government. The Arab Spring revolutions effectively deposed President Ben Ali, and within four years Tunisia had “adopted a progressive constitution, held fair parliamentary elections, and ushered in the country’s first ever democratically elected president.” (Masri) Despite this initial ‘success,’ the country still faced relative turmoil, as the post Arab Spring government failed to fully resolve economic burdens, and focused instead on political reform. Problematically, the political and democratic reform in Tunisia did not truly address the root of the revolution - the economy. The new government focused “almost exclusively on building a consensus for political transition and tackling security issues. The economy was secondary.” (Atlantic) Tunisia continues to suffer from slowing economic growth, high unemployment, large budget deficits, and expanding wealth inequality between rural and urban areas. Terrorism in the country has resulted in a decrease of profit from the tourism industry, further weakening the economy. Economic grievances are, in fact, worse than they were before the revolution. After the Arab Spring, 80% of Tunisians now cite economic issues as the greatest problem facing their country, while 74% percent believe that economic improvement should be the top priority of the government (IRI). Compared to 2011, more Tunisians (87%) believed in 2019 that the current economic situation is “somewhat or very bad.” (Figure 2) The new governments “failed to fully internalize the significant impact of economic developments on the country’s still nascent transition and paid only lip service to economic reform and policies,” resulting in a worsening of economic vulnerabilities (Atlantic). A Qatari professor has noted that in Tunisia, “what can be described as a dramatic transformation at the political level has not translated into economic and social gains for the majority.” (Allahoum)\n",
      "Given the centrality of economic grievances in fostering revolution, the failure to address economic woes has left intact the seeds for ongoing revolution which threatens the emerging democratic government in Tunisia. In fact, opinion polls now suggest that three times as many Tunisians favor a strong economy over democratic rule (Figure 3). The desire for economic stability, and worsening economic trends, suggests that Tunisia may be headed for ongoing political change. “The lack of economic progress risks undermining all of the very painstaking political progress gained thus far,” and without economic stability “social and political stability…will remain elusive.” (Ghanem) Despite the relative initial success of the Arab Spring revolutions, a fundamental vulnerability of Tunisia- a lack of economic opportunity- still remains and poses a threat to the stability to the young democratic government.\n",
      "The vulnerabilities of a poor economy, political discontent, and a corrupt political culture, set the stage for the Arab Spring in Tunisia. The post-Arab Spring government has introduced some political reform, successful in part due to the culture of dissent, strong civil institutions and lack of a powerful military. But the persistence of inadequate economic opportunities, particularly among the young an educated population, has left the democratic momentum of the Arab Spring susceptible to another wave of political turmoil which might topple any political progress. Until economic progress is achieved and maintained, political progress will remain in jeopardy in Tunisia.\n",
